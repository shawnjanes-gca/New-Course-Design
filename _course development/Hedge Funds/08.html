  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Hedge Funds: Low Correlation, Greater Diversification </span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Another key benefit hedge funds can offer is the potential to achieve greater portfolio diversification. Institutional and individual investors alike are seeking ways to further diversify their portfolios and optimize performance. Hedge funds typically have extremely low correlations (the lower the correlation coefficient, the more diversification potential) relative to traditional approaches and standard benchmarks, making them a highly effective strategy for those seeking to enhance portfolio diversification.</p>
  <p>To further illustrate the potential diversification benefits offered by hedge funds, consider the following. Because hedge funds, as evidenced by the index returns, provide a higher average annualized return with lower standard deviation (i.e. volatility), they are a very effective way to increase overall portfolio return and dampen overall volatility. The result of adding hedge fund positions or allocations to a client's overall asset mix can be a more efficient portfolio structure.</p>
  <p>The bottom line is simple - participants can potentially reduce the risk profile of their overall portfolio by investing a portion of their assets in a well-diversified hedge fund. </p>
