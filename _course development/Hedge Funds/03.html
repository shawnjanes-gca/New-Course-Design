<p>The confusion that many have in understanding hedge funds is often the result of the dual use of the term "hedge" in reference to the legal structure of the entity versus the strategy of "hedging". Hedging as an investment strategy implies the use of leverage in some form to either expose or protect a portfolio from market or security movements. Most typically, hedging refers to a long position in a portfolio with a component in a short position to protect the assets from downside risk. However, just as the terms "Mutual Fund" or "Common Trust Fund" do not accurately describe the strategies applied in all of these vehicles, the term "hedging" does not necessarily reflect the strategy employed in all hedge funds. In fact, there are some hedge funds that do not use any hedging strategies at all. Simply put, Hedge Funds are little different from Mutual Funds in that they are pooled investment vehicles. The primary differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hedge Funds are Private Placement offerings organized as Limited Partnerships or Limited Liability Companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge Funds can only be offered to a limited number of "Accredited Investors" and/or "Qualified Purchasers"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge Funds are not regulated by the SEC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge Funds are granted more investment management flexibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most significant challenges in positioning hedge funds with clients is educating them on what a hedge fund is. Often, individuals will confuse "hedge funds" with "hedging."</p>
