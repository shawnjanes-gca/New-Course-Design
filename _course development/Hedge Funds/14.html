                <p>The Offering Memorandum, also called the Private Placement Memorandum, Disclosure Document or Prospectus, provides a general summary of the hedge fund and partnership agreement. This document includes information on the fees, the investment strategy to be employed, redemption features of the fund, information on the investment manager and key staff, and other information important for the investor to understand before making an investment in the partnership. In essence, it is the first legal disclosure the investor will receive regarding the fund itself and is very similar in nature to the prospectus of a common mutual fund.</p>

                <p>The Subscription Agreement is an application to the partnership for acceptance into the fund. Remember that a hedge fund is a private placement offering. As such, investors are screened and invited based on certain restrictions. The Subscription Agreement requires the investor to provide specific information regarding their suitability for inclusion into the partnership.</p>

                <p>Also commonly referred to as the Limited Partnership Agreement, this document is a contract between the investor (limited partner) and the partnership. The purpose of this document is to clearly specify the rights and obligations of both the limited and general partners and the structure of the operation for the partnership. Every investor is required to sign the Partnership Agreement, thereby agreeing to abide by the rules and obligations set forth.</p>
                <p>Each and every year, the partnership will prepare a K-1 partnership form for tax purposes. Every investor in the partnership will receive this form, indicating the tax consequences of the investment activities related to the funds activities over the previous year. </p>
