  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Benefits of a Fund of Funds Structure</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>For many investors, a Fund of Funds structure provides significant benefits that outweigh the existence of an additional layer of fees (and potentially carried interest). If you, as an advisor, have determined that a Fund of Funds structure is most appropriate for an individual, it is important that you be well versed in communicating these benefits.</p>

                <p>No different from any other asset class, selecting attractive hedge funds requires experience and insight coupled with a disciplined process of research and analysis. Likewise, the hedge funds must be proactively monitored to ensure they are managed effectively on an ongoing basis. This is a process few individuals have the time or experience to implement. A Fund of Funds structure is managed by the General Partner responsible for providing ongoing oversight of the individual hedge funds that are held in the Fund.</p>

                <p>Because a Fund of Funds invests in multiple hedge fund strategies, the Fund can achieve broader diversification across multiple approaches. Achieving this level of diversification by participating directly in a similar number of qualified hedge funds would require significant assets.</p>

                <p>Many hedge funds require high minimum initial investments (some as high as $10 million). Because assets are pooled, a Fund of Funds structure can provide individuals a means of participating in these funds without having to commit to the normal minimum initial investment. Likewise, many of the top funds may be closed to new individual investors. A Fund of Funds can provide access to these premium funds.</p>
