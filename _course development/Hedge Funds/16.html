  <p>Understanding the basic structure of a hedge fund as a limited partnership is only the first level of knowledge necessary. The domicile of the hedge fund has a specific impact on the profile and objectives, and especially the tax consequences for a hedge fund investor.</p>

                <p>Domestic hedge funds, structured in the United States, are the most commonly used by individual investors. They are taxed just like mutual funds or separately managed accounts, with all tax burdens flowing through to the limited partners investing in the fund. Gains are taxed at the qualifying rate, either short-term or long-term, and losses in the fund can offset gains. Dividends are taxed as income.</p>

                <p>Offshore hedge funds are domiciled in tax havens such as Bermuda, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Ireland or other tax havens throughout the world. While these offshore funds typically utilize a corporate structure in their formation, there is no entity level tax imposed on the clientele because of the situs of the fund. </p>

  <p>Offshore funds are primarily for non-U.S. investors, but they also have specific advantages for tax-exempt U. S. entities. U. S. tax-exempt entities (e.g., 501(c) Corporations) investing in a typical domestic hedge fund structure would be subject to taxation on all gains deemed to be unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). While it requires a specific legal opinion from the tax-exempt entity's counsel, UBTI may include income or gains that were the result of the use of leverage in the fund or through any acquisition indebtedness that may be part of a specific hedge fund's strategy. Because such leverage might be the primary way that a hedge fund generates return, the offshore status of the partnership may help eliminate the tax implications related to UBTI. The only downside to the offshore status for these investors would be the lack of U.S. government oversight and recourse under U.S. laws.</p>
