  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Investor Requirements</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Up until 1996, hedge funds structured as limited partnerships, in order to remain outside the auspices and control of the SEC and the Investment Company Act of 1940, were restricted to 100 total partners, generally one (1) General Partner and ninety-nine (99) Limited Partners (investors). Obviously, this maximum limit on the number of investors in a hedge fund was restrictive. Therefore, in 1996, Congress passed the National Market Securities Improvement Act of 1996 that effectively expanded the maximum number of participants in a private investment partnership to provide for no more than 99 &quot;Accredited investors&quot; and no more than 499 &quot;Qualified Purchasers.&quot;</p>
  <p>The following is a detailed description of the qualification standards that each investor in a hedge fund (or any other private investment offering) must meet. <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each term to view more information.</span></p>
