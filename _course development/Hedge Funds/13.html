<p>Up until 1996, hedge funds structured as limited partnerships, in order to remain outside the auspices and control of the SEC and the Investment Company Act of 1940, were restricted to 100 total partners, generally one (1) General Partner and ninety-nine (99) Limited Partners (investors). Obviously, this maximum limit on the number of investors in a hedge fund was restrictive. Therefore, in 1996, Congress passed the National Market Securities Improvement Act of 1996 that effectively expanded the maximum number of participants in a private investment partnership to provide for no more than 99 "Accredited investors" and no more than 499 "Qualified Purchasers."</p>

<p>An Accredited Investor is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Act of 1933. Generally speaking, an accredited investor is defined as an individual who:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is a natural person whose net worth, or net worth joint with their spouse, is over $1 million dollars; OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had an annual income of $200,000 or more for the past two years (or $300,000 jointly with a spouse) and has a reasonable expectation of reaching that level in the current year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are far more numerous definitions for Accredited Investors that are formed as an "entity". In general, institutions or other "entities" must have at least $5,000,000 in investable assets and must not be formed for the purpose of investing in the fund. For a list of such entities, <span class="style2"><strong>click <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show','Layer2','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;">here</a></span></strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The intent is that any investor who meet the qualifications set forth have a degree of sophistication and understanding that allows them to evaluate the inherent risks in the investment strategy and thereby do not need the oversight of the SEC or other government agency to safeguard them in their investment efforts.</p>

<p>In general, a "Qualified Purchaser" is a "natural person" with at least $5,000,000 in investable assets. Investment assets include any asset held for its investment value and purpose. This does not include holdings such as residential or business related real estate, or controlling interests in privately held businesses. For an institution, the definition of a "Qualified Purchaser" relates, in general, to investment assets exceeding $25 million.</p>
