<h3><a id="p7ABt1_1" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Shorting Securities</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Previous to the National Market Securities Improvement Act of 1996, mutual funds were prohibited from selling securities short. While this Act repealed that restriction, very few mutual funds employ this strategy. On the other hand, hedge funds tend to use it more frequently. "Shorting" is the act of selling something you do not own, which creates a "short" position in the fund portfolio. It is accomplished by borrowing a security to deliver against the sale, with the expectation that the security will drop in value, allowing the fund to buy it back in the open market at a lower price and cover the debt with the "cheaper" security. Shorting allows the fund to generate positive returns, even in a bear market; but it also introduces an element of risk because prices could increase, requiring short positions to be covered at higher prices. It should also be noted that shorting rules, i.e., selling short only on an uptick, must be followed by hedge funds just as with any other investors.</p>
<p>Another common use for a short position in a hedge fund is to offset the "systematic risk" (i.e. general market exposure risk) of a corresponding long position. Systematic risk is risk related to the portfolios general exposure to the market itself. In simplistic terms, having a portfolio that is 50% long, with a corresponding 50% short position, the portfolio has a market neutral stance and is not as susceptible to the direction of the market itself. However, the portfolio still has the potential to generate positive returns because of the movement of its individual holdings. This can allow the manager to lower the general risk profile of the fund while maintaining the ability to generate returns.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>The Ability to Use Leverage</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Leverage occurs when a manager establishes total positions in the fund that exceed the total value of the funds assets. The primary way of establishing this excess exposure is through the purchase of futures, options or commodities. All of these instruments are derivatives, meaning that their value is based on another underlying security or asset such as a bond, stock, or index. Because these instruments allow a manager to establish an exposure to the underlying security without having to directly buy the security itself, the manager is able to establish full exposure to the asset or security with a smaller upfront dollar commitment. If prices move as anticipated, this strategy may produce incrementally higher rates of return than in a portfolio owning the underlying asset itself, just as purchasing securities on margin can leverage an individual's portfolio. Likewise, it introduces increased risk because of the leverage that is being employed.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Greater Concentration</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In many hedge funds, the manager has expertise in a specific niche of the market. Because of the limited size of hedge funds, in comparison to mutual funds, the manager may achieve greater concentration in that particular niche. Allowing the manager to narrow his/her focus, seems to provide even greater knowledge and understanding of that particular segment of the market. But consider that greater concentration can also concentrate the risks.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_4" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Greater Flexibility</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Hedge Funds generally afford the portfolio manager greater flexibility than Mutual Funds in managing the portfolio. Specifically, Hedge Funds can use leverage and sell short, and are not subject to the diversification restrictions imposed on Mutual Funds. In addition to being subject to less burdensome regulatory requirements, Hedge Funds are typically smaller than Mutual Funds, enabling the mangers to react more quickly to changes in the market. But take heed and realize that if improperly utilized, shorting, leveraging, and less regulation can increase risk to the investor.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_5" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Performance-Based Fees</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Unlike regulated funds, hedge fund managers can have their fees tied to the performance of the fund. This has lured a number of the most successful managers in the country to the hedge fund management industry. For successful managers, this provides substantial earnings potential in excess of that which is available from traditional fund management; therefore, some contend that hedge funds tend to attract the best and brightest managers. Others note that this can create incentive for the manager to take on higher risk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_6" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Adaptability to Changing Markets</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_6">
<div id="p7ABc1_6" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The ability for managers to utilize a full complement of investment techniques and securities allows them the ability to be much more nimble and creative in their pursuit of investment returns. The use of leverage, shorting and other derivative instruments are not always available to managers in traditional investment vehicles, which can limit their return potential, especially in a bear market.</p>
<p>Do note that as we will discuss later in this course, there are many types of hedge fund strategies. The ability of a manager to generate investment returns is dependent upon their strategy and their skill in adapting to various market environments. There is never a guarantee of positive returns in any strategy, inclusive of hedge.</p>
