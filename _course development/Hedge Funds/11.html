<p><strong>The Limited Partnership</strong></p>
<p>In a limited partnership, the investors are limited partners and the investment manager(s) are general partners. In this legal structure, the Limited Partners have liability limited to the amount of money that they invest in the partnership. However, the General Partners, who most often have a portion of their personal assets invested in the partnership, will have unlimited liability. This unlimited liability stems mainly from the use of leverage, where losses can exceed the amount of money invested.</p>

<p>One of the more important issues related to hedge funds is understanding the legal structure of these investment vehicles. As we have stated earlier, a hedge fund is a private investment partnership. The impetus for establishing a hedge fund in part relates to the ability to avoid the regulation, reporting requirements and oversight of the SEC. The primary purpose in this effort is to achieve the freedom to employ more aggressive investment tactics, such as hedging and using leverage to either enhance performance or mitigate downside volatility. To effectively garner this investment freedom, domestic hedge funds are formed as limited partnerships.</p>
