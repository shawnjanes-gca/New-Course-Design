              <p>When evaluating the performance of hedge funds, it is important to consider the after tax returns. While the absolute returns may be spectacular, oftentimes the excessive realization of short-term gains can significantly degrade performance, as they are taxed at rates up to 35%. Any investor in a hedge fund should clearly understand that these vehicles are not necessarily tax efficient, and investors should maintain sufficient liquidity in other holdings to cover the potential tax liabilities that can be incurred.</p>

            <div class="p7ap3-col-wrapper no-columns">
              <p>Another consideration is the liquidity of the fund. Many hedge funds have limited withdrawal windows, sometimes as limited as once a year. This may be an important issue for individuals and a very important consideration for tax-exempt entities, particularly when investing in offshore funds. If there is the potential need for access to the invested assets, the investor may be best served to find a partnership with monthly withdrawal opportunity.</p>

              <p>Investors should keep in mind that hedge funds are private placement offerings and as such are not subject to normal disclosure rules regarding their investment practices. While it is probably in their best interests to keep clients informed, the fund managers and General Partner have no duty to do so. Investors should do considerable due diligence before selecting any fund.</p>
