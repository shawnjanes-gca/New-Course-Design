  <p>It is important to understand that these private placement investments cannot be advertised or discussed with the general public. Any communication regarding these investments, including general discussions or solicitations, can be made only to investors that meet certain requirements that denote them as either an &quot;Accredited Investor&quot; or a &quot;Qualified Purchaser.&quot; What constitutes an Accredited Investor and a Qualified Purchaser is addressed on the following page. Failure to comply with these restrictions jeopardizes the private nature of the offering and thereby causing the fund to lose its &quot;hedge fund&quot; status.</p>
