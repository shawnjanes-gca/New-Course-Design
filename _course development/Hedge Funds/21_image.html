  <h1><span class="pagetitle">A Fund of Funds Structure: An Attractive Alternative</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Each of these individual approaches to managing a hedge fund has merit. However, just as with traditional investments, approaches tend to move in and out of favor. To achieve diversification across multiple management approaches would typically require an individual to have a large pool of assets and the time and expertise required to select and oversee hedge fund managers in each discipline. Clearly this is a strategy that very few can employ.</p>
  <p>The solution for investors seeking a hedge fund that is broadly diversified across multiple strategies is a fund of funds. Fund of Funds are simply pooled investment vehicles that invest in several different funds. Under this structure, investors (limited partners) invest in a hedge fund of funds which is managed by the Fund's General Partner.</p>
  <p>The Fund Manager then invests the assets in hedge funds to build a diversified portfolio invested in multiple hedge fund strategies. To put it in very simple terms, the Manager of a Fund of Funds simply selects hedge fund managers for the portfolio in a manner very similar to how a mutual fund portfolio manager selects individual securities for their mutual funds.</p>
  <p>The diagram below gives a graphic illustration of how a Fund of Funds is structured.</p>
