  <p>As outlined previously, hedge funds allow managers greater latitude and flexibility in the strategies they can employ in managing the funds. However, discussing these features can often lead to the client becoming confused and/or turned off by what they may perceive to be a highly risky approach. It is important, therefore, that you focus first on communicating the key benefits hedge funds may offer. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each key benefit to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>Because hedge funds are granted the ability to utilize a wider range of investment strategies, including the use of leverage, they have the <strong><u>potential</u></strong> to generate higher returns than traditional investment approaches. This <strong><u>potential</u></strong> for higher returns has been a strong lure for many investors. Prompted by stories from others detailing dramatic returns from hedge funds, many investors have sought those same rewards. However, just because this flexibility provides the <strong><u>potential</u></strong> for increased returns does not mean that all hedge fund investments will be effective.  It is important that investors be very careful in conducting due diligence when selecting a hedge fund.  In this analysis, it is important to also understand that hedge funds are not held to the same level of disclosure requirements as traditional investments, so this due diligence can be more difficult in many instances. </p>

              <p>The more quantifiable reason, and the more prudent basis for making an allocation to a hedge fund, is the potential for increased diversification. A study by Duke University found that over half of all mutual funds had a correlation to the market of greater than 75%, while, in contrast, over half of all hedge funds have a correlation to the market of less than 25%. This study is clear evidence that by investing a portion of a portfolio in hedge funds, investors are able to achieve higher levels of diversification in their overall portfolio. </p>
