<h2>Communicating Hedge Fund Fees</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as it is important to help potential investors understand and evaluate the benefits of investing in a hedge fund, it is important that they also understand the fees charged by the fund. Although similar in some respects to traditional investment approaches in that hedge funds typically charge an annual management fee on the assets invested in the fund, hedge funds typically charge a performance-based fee as well. This results in hedge fund fees that can be significantly higher than with other traditional investments. Following is an overview of the fee structures typically employed in hedge funds.</p>
<h4>Management &amp; Administrative Fees</h4>
<p>These fees are charged separately to investors to cover the investment management of the assets and general expenses of the fund and its operations. Generally, the investment management fee will range from 1-2% of the assets under management, with the administrative fee running much smaller.</p>
<h4>Performance Fees</h4>
<p>The performance fee can be the most substantial fee that is charged to the investor. This fee is in addition to any other fees that are charged on either a monthly or an annual basis, and relate to the general partners sharing in the overall returns of the fund. Generally, performance-based fees are charged as 20% of the total returns of the fund. While this may seem simple, there are three primary methods used to calculate the performance-based fee.</p>

<p>Some managers allocate 20% of the total return of the fund to the general partners. In this case, if the fund has a 10% return for the year, a return of 2% will be allocated to the general partner.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In this case, there is a "bogey" that the manager must beat in order to earn the performance fee. Generally, the manager defines an index or other appropriate benchmark against which the funds returns are compared. The manager earns 20% of any incremental gains above the benchmark.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The third variation of performance-based fees in hedge funds is based on a high-water mark for the fund's assets. As the market value increases during each fee period (typically a year), it sets a new "water mark". If the value at the end of a fee period has declined from the previous period, then no performance based-fee is due for that period or any subsequent period until the value rises back up above that "water mark" at the end of a fee period. This fee structure is designed to protect the limited partners in the fund from excessive fees. All losses from one fee period carryover to subsequent years, the losses must be recouped before the general partner receives performance incentive fees. Without this feature, a fund could lose half its value in one period, and charge a performance fee for regaining that loss in the following period.</p>

<p>Clearly the fees associated with investing in a hedge fund will normally be higher than the fees charged by traditional investment vehicles. Because the fees can be higher, you should be prepared to simply describe the methods used to calculate performance-based fees and discuss the potential value that hedge funds may add to an overall portfolio, thus offsetting the higher costs. Following are some of the reasons investors should consider when evaluating the fees charged by a hedge fund. First, many hedge funds are able to charge higher fees because of the expertise of the managers and the ability to generate higher total returns than traditional investment alternatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, hedge funds are typically limited in the total amount of assets they can manage effectively. Because many funds cap the size of the fund, they need to charge higher fees to generate the level of revenues required to maintain their operations and provide competitive compensation to the manager in order to retain them.</p>
