    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The first real question to answer is, "What is a Hedge Fund?" In many respects, hedge funds are very similar in nature and structure to mutual funds or Common Trust Funds in that they are all pooled investment vehicles managed under a specific investment mandate. The major difference in a hedge fund is its legal structure. Hedge funds are private investment partnerships and, as such, are not subject to regulation by the SEC. Because hedge funds are not subject to oversight by the SEC, they are able to employ more diverse investment strategies than traditional investment vehicles.</p>
  <p>One of the easiest ways to help clients understand hedge funds is to compare them to traditional pooled investment vehicles (such as Mutual Funds, Common Trust Funds, etc.) The chart below gives a detailed comparison of hedge funds and traditional pooled investment vehicles.  Keep in mind that these are general comparisons and will not always hold true.  For example, some traditional investments do use short interest.</p>
