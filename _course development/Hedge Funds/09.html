  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Important Note About Hedge Fund Investments</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The previous pages have discussed the numerous benefits of investing in hedge funds.  While it has been indicated previously, it is important to note that hedge funds provide the POTENTIAL for these benefits, yet not every hedge fund will deliver these benefits in all circumstances.  This is no different than with any other investment strategy or investment manager.  Every investment in a hedge fund should be scrutinized to ensure that the fund meets the unique needs of each client.  In addition, as is the case with any other investment, the fund should be continuously monitored to assess the ongoing effectiveness and validity of the investment. </p></div>
