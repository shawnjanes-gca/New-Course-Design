  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Owner's Death ON or AFTER the RBD (With a Designated Beneficiary) - Spouse Beneficiary</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>According to IRS guidelines, the distribution options for a spouse beneficiary are as follows.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Distribution Options for a Spouse Beneficiary</strong></p>
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>Roll over or transfer to spouse's own IRA</strong>
<p>After the IRA owner's death, the spouse can roll over or transfer the assets to his or her own IRA.  The spouse can then name new beneficiaries.  Also, if the spouse is under age 70½, annual distributions can be delayed until his or her Required Beginning Date.</p>
			<p><em>Note: If the spouse beneficiary is younger than 59½ and needs to take distributions for current income, they may not want to roll the assets over to his or her own IRA since the distributions may be subject to the 10% penalty.  Instead, the spouse should establish an inherited IRA and take RMDs based on the deceased spouse's life expectancy so that the 10% penalty would not apply to those distributions.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>RMDs based on the spouse beneficiary's single life expectancy</strong>
<p>The spouse can take annual distributions from the deceased owner's IRA over the surviving spouse's single life expectancy.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>RMDs where the spouse beneficiary is older than the IRA owner</strong>
<p>If the spouse beneficiary is older than the IRA owner, RMDs may be based on the IRA owner's remaining single life expectancy. This would result in a smaller RMD amount than if the spouse's single life expectancy was used.  The remaining life expectancy is determined as of the deceased owner's birthday in the year of death and reduced by one each subsequent year following death.</p>
