  <h3>Trust</h3>
  <p>Naming a trust as the beneficiary can be a complex undertaking. The regulations explicitly state that a trust must meet some very specific requirements ("look through" rules) in order for the beneficiaries of the trust to be regarded as designated beneficiaries. Otherwise, the IRA is treated as having no designated beneficiaries and the required distributions will be computed as with any other entity. <span class="pageInstruction">View an example below.</span></p>
  <div class="example-box">
  	<p>The specific criteria ("look through" rules) that must be met to provide the trust beneficiaries the status of Designated Beneficiaries are:</p>
    <ol style="width:95%">
   	    <li><span>The trust must be valid under state law (or would be if it was funded).</span></li>
           <li><span>The trust must be irrevocable or will become irrevocable at the death of the owner.</span></li>
           <li><span>The trust instrument must clearly identify the beneficiaries, who must be within the definition of a designated beneficiary.</span></li>
           <li><span>The plan administrator or custodian must be provided with specific documentation pertaining to the trust, such as the following:</span></li>
    
    <ul>
      <li><span>A <strong><em>copy of the trust document and any  amendments</em></strong>, such amendments being delivered to the plan administrator  or IRA custodian by October 31 of the year following the year of the owner's  death, or</span></li>
      <li><span>A<strong><em> list of all beneficiaries of the trust,</em></strong> including contingent beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries, with  descriptions of the provisions for their entitlement.</span></li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Compliance with these requirements is much more complicated than might first appear. For example:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>How are contingent beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries treated? </li>
        <li>What happens if income and principal is at the trustee's discretion? </li>
        <li>What is the effect of a charity being named as a remainder beneficiary?</li>
        <li>What is the effect of the surviving spouse being the sole income beneficiary?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is beyond the scope of this module to resolve such issues. Simply be aware that they do exist. Nonetheless, a properly drafted trust can expand the IRA distribution options beyond those normally permitted for entities. </p>

  <h3>Charitable Organization</h3>
  <p>The IRA owner may desire to use the IRA assets for charitable purposes upon death. This could be accomplished by naming the charity as a beneficiary. However, given that the charity has no life expectancy, it cannot be a "designated beneficiary." In this case, the slowest available payout is based on the fixed term life expectancy of the IRA owner as of the year of his/her death (if death occurs on or after RBD), or upon the Five-Year Rule if death occurred before reaching the Required Beginning Date.</p>
