  </h1>
  <p>The regulations governing lifetime and after-death distributions from IRAs generally apply to all of the following:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), excluding ROTH IRAs</li>
    <li>403(b) Plans</li>
    <li>Qualified retirement plans, such as profit sharing, 401(k), ESOP, and stock bonus plans</li>
    <li>Simplified Employee Plans or SEP IRAs</li>
    <li>Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees or SIMPLEs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In general, the regulations apply evenly to all the plans listed and may also apply to others not listed. However, there are some subtle variations and special rules that relate to each particular plan type. For the purposes of this module and simplicity's sake, we will focus our comments on the application for owners and beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts.  To limit the scope of the course, we will not cover the beneficiary distribution rules associated with annuitizing an IRA.</p>
