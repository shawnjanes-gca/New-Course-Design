    <p>* Henceforth, we will refer to Traditional IRAs as "IRAs" and we will distinguish the specific identity of Roth IRAs. The vast majority of this course material applies to Traditional IRAs since the distribution of after-death Traditional IRA assets is always at least partially income-taxable. After-death Roth IRA distributions are almost always never subject to income tax.</p>
