<p>There are many different situations where distributions from an IRA are required. This module is focused on distributions that are required upon the death of the IRA owner and the planning required for those with significant IRA balances. While relevant in some instances, this module does not deal with the tactics and implications of distributions during the IRA owner's life.</p>
<p>There are two specific occasions when distributions <strong><em>must</em></strong> occur from an IRA.</p>

<p>In order to limit the time that an IRA (excluding a ROTH IRA) can maintain tax-deferred status, the IRS has enacted rules that require the IRA owner to begin making distributions from an IRA upon attaining age 70&frac12;. These rules are tools of the IRS to ensure that the IRA is used for the primary purpose of retirement planning for the owner and his or her spouse. The rules force the IRA owner to take a minimum distribution from the IRA on an annual basis, based on life expectancy.</p>

<p>The second instance when the IRA must distribute assets is upon the death of the IRA owner, which is the subject of this module. There are numerous options for how the assets are distributed, and the alternatives hinge on the choices made and planning that is done both before and after death. The choice of the designated beneficiary and the distribution choices available to the beneficiary will require some knowledge of the topic.</p>
