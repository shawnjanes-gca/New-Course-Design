  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Top Choices for a Designated Beneficiary</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>While every situation is different, and each case requires specific analysis, the following is intended to provide general thoughts on the most commonly effective choices for a designated beneficiary. </p>
  <h3>Spouse</h3>
  <p>In many cases, the spouse is named as the primary beneficiary for any retirement plan assets or IRA. In fact, if the assets are held in a qualified plan such as a 401(k), the spouse is generally entitled to 50% of the assets unless spousal consent is provided to name other beneficiaries. There is, however, a potential problem that surfaces when the couple has a significant amount of their net worth in the IRA assets. In this case, they may need to use their IRA to fund a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Every individual is provided with a credit against estate taxes.  A common estate planning technique for large estates is to fund a Credit Shelter Trust upon the first spouse's death with those assets that can be protected from taxation by use of the applicable estate tax credit amount.  The balance of the estate can then be transferred to the surviving spouse and be protected from estate taxation by applying the unlimited marital deduction.  Through this method, there is no estate tax upon the death of the first spouse and the estate tax bill upon the second spouse's death will be lower because the Credit Shelter Trust assets will not be included in the surviving spouse's estate.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Credit Shelter Trust</a>. Typically, in these situations it is preferable to name the spouse as the primary beneficiary and the trust as the contingent beneficiary. This allows the surviving spouse the flexibility of choosing to establish his/her own IRA with the proceeds or simply disclaim the interest to allow the trust to become the beneficiary.</p>
  <h3>Grandchildren / Younger Generation Individuals</h3>
  <p>In cases where there is no spouse and the goal is to extend the life of the IRA and provide for the future of another generation, the designated beneficiary could be either grandchildren or other younger individuals. It is important, however, to consider the impact of <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;The Generation Skipping Transfer (GST) tax is imposed on transfers of property to “skip persons”.  Skip Persons are defined as individuals who are two or more generations below that of the person transferring the property.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Generation Skipping Transfer Taxes</a> and the most effective utilization of the GST Exemption when naming younger generation individuals as designated beneficiaries of the IRA.</p>
  <p>The benefit of this strategy relates to the minimization of Required Minimum Distributions, as these payouts are calculated on the life expectancy of the grandchild. The disadvantage is the fact that if multiple beneficiaries are named, the payouts upon the death of the owner will be based on the oldest beneficiary. To avert this, the IRA can be segmented into separate accounts, each with a single beneficiary, thereby providing the ultimate in flexibility for each specific beneficiary.</p>
