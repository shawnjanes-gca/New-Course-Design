<h2>Limitations on Changing Designated Beneficiaries after Death</h2>
</blockquote>
</td>

<tr>

<blockquote>
<p>Given that the beneficiaries are determined so long after death, it might appear possible to "subvert" the regulations by changing the beneficiary after death, thereby selecting the most advantageous distribution options. While the designated beneficiary is determined on September 30 of the calendar year following the year of death, this does <strong>NOT</strong> provide unlimited flexibility to change the designated beneficiary. <strong><em>Only the individual or those individuals named as beneficiaries, or contingent beneficiaries, at the time of death are eligible to be designated beneficiaries.</em></strong></p>
<p>However, during the time period between the IRA owner's death and the date in which the designated beneficiaries are determined, the beneficiaries may impact the distributions from the IRA by arranging to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disclaim all or part of their interest in the IRA, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash out their interest in the IRA through a distribution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Disclaiming an interest in the IRA before the Determination Date has the same effect as if the disclaiming party has predeceased the IRA owner, thereby being removed from the group of designated beneficiaries. In like manner, if a beneficiary cashes out his or her interest in the IRA through a distribution prior to the determination date, that beneficiary will be removed from the group of designated beneficiaries. In either case, upon the determination date, only the life expectancies of the designated beneficiaries remaining on the Determination Date are considered for calculating RMDs.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Rule for Changing Beneficiaries After Death</strong></p>
<p>There are three rules to remember about "changing beneficiaries" after death:<strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Only beneficiaries named before the IRA owner's death are eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible beneficiaries may be reduced in number by one or more by disclaiming their interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible beneficiaries may be reduced in number by one or more by receiving their entire benefit before the Determination Date.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Within these parameters, some postmortem planning is possible, which will be discussed later in this course.</p>
