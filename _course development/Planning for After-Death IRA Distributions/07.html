  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Determining Final Beneficiaries</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Whether the IRA owner's beneficiaries qualify as designated  beneficiaries is determined as of September 30 of the year following the year  of the IRA owner's death.Â  This is known  as the &quot;<strong><em>Determination Date</em></strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>For  clarity, the timeline below shows an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="greene/planning_for_after_death_IRA_distr/images/Determining_Final_Beneficiaries.svg" width="590" height="211" alt=""/></p>
  <p>As  you can see in the above illustration, the time period between the IRA owner's  death and the determination of the designated beneficiary for RMD purposes  allows a period of time (at least 9 months) in which there is some potential flexibility  in formulating estate planning strategies. There are, however, limitations as  to how much these designations can change.</p>
