  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Owner's Death BEFORE the RBD (Without a Designated Beneficiary)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>If there are no designated beneficiaries upon the death of the IRA owner (e.g., a charity is named as the beneficiary), only one distribution option is available.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Distribution Options with No Designated Beneficiary</strong></p>
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>The "Five-Year Rule"</strong>
        	<p>The entire IRA balance must be fully distributed by the end of the calendar year that contains the fifth anniversary of the date of the IRA owner's death.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
  </div>
  <h3>Estate Planning Strategy Considerations</h3>
  <p>Since designated beneficiaries are not determined until September 30 of the year that follows the year of the IRA owner's death, there is a window of time that provides some flexibility for postmortem (after death) planning. Such planning is the subject of the next page.</p>
  <h3>Special Rules when Naming a Trust as Beneficiary</h3>
  <p>When a trust that meets certain requirements is named as the beneficiary, the <strong><em>&quot;look  through&quot; rules</em></strong> apply. These rules will be discussed in more detail later in the course.  Under these rules, the individual beneficiary of the trust is considered to be the designated beneficiary of the IRA for purposes of determining RMDs after the IRA owner's death.  If there are multiple beneficiaries of the  trust, it is not permissible to use separate accountings for each beneficiary;  rather, you must go to the Multiple Individuals (no separate accounts) options,  which in the case of death before the RBD would require either using the oldest  beneficiary's single life expectancy or the &quot;five-year rule.&quot;</p>
