  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Owner's Death BEFORE the RBD (With a Designated Beneficiary) - Spouse Beneficiary</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>If the sole beneficiary is the IRA owner's spouse, the surviving spouse can elect to be treated as an owner of the IRA or as a  beneficiary of the IRA.  If the surviving  spouse is among a number of beneficiaries upon the Determination Date, then the  surviving spouse is treated as any other person if there are no separate  accounts; however, if there are separate accounts, then the surviving spouse  has the same options regarding his or her portion as would be available as the  sole designated beneficiary.</p>
  <p>The following distribution  options are available to the spouse beneficiary.</p>
  <div class="example-box"><h3 style="text-align:center">Distribution Options for a Spouse Beneficiary</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li><strong>As an Owner</strong>
			<p>After the IRA owner's death, the surviving spouse can elect to be treated as the owner of the IRA.  In this case, the surviving spouse could roll over or transfer the assets to his or her own IRA.  The surviving spouse can then name new beneficiaries and, if the spouse is under age 70½, annual distributions can be delayed until his or her Required Beginning Date.</p>
         </li>
         <li><strong>As a Beneficiary</strong>
         		<p>If the spouse elects to be treated as a beneficiary of the deceased spouse's IRA, then the surviving spouse has the following options:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><strong>Make distributions based on the spouse beneficiary's single life expectancy</strong>
                    	<p>The surviving spouse can take annual distributions from the deceased owner's IRA over the surviving spouse's own annually recalculated single life expectancy. </p>
                    </li>
                   	<li><strong>Make distributions based on deceased spouses age 70½</strong>
                    	<p>However, rather than basing the required beginning date upon when the surviving spouse turns 70½, the surviving spouse can elect to begin making required minimum distributions in the year in which the deceased spouse would have turned 70½.  For example, a surviving spouse who is 5 years older could defer required minimum distributions by making this election.</p>
                    </li>
         			<li><strong>Make distributions based on the "Five-Year Rule"</strong>
                    	<p>Under this option, the surviving spouse can elect to deplete the IRA within five years of the IRA owner's death</p>
               		</li>
              	</ul>
         </li>
