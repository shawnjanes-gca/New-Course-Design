  <p>Beneficiary designations generally will not have a  significant impact on RMDs during the IRA owner's lifetime.  They will, however, have a significant impact  on the payout options after the IRA owner's death.</p>
<p>After the IRA owner's death, the beneficiaries must withdraw  the funds from the IRA within a certain period of time.  The IRS's RMD rules will not allow the assets  to be kept in the IRA indefinitely.</p>
<p>The maximum time to withdraw funds from an IRA depends upon:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The IRA owner's date of death in relation to the Required Beginning Date (RBD).</li>
  <li>Whether only natural persons are named as designated beneficiaries,</li>
  <li>The designated beneficiary's age in the year following the year of the IRA owner's death, and/or</li>
  <li>Whether the sole, primary beneficiary is the IRA owner's spouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, we will look at how the RMD rules affect the determination  of final beneficiaries.  Second, we will  look at the options available for various types of beneficiaries if the owner  dies before the Required Beginning Date (RBD).   Finally, we will address the options available if the owner dies on or after  the Required Beginning Date.</p>
