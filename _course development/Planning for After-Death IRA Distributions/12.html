<h2>Required Distributions for Roth IRAs</h2>

<p>Given that Roth IRAs do not have a required beginning date, this raises the question as to what rules will apply for required distributions of Roth IRAs after the death of the owner. The answer is that the rules that are applicable to beneficiaries of Roth IRAs are the same rules that apply to traditional IRAs when the IRA owner dies prior to the required beginning date. This is true regardless of the age of the owner of the Roth IRA when he or she dies.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Sylvia's Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Sylvia died at the age of 78 and was the owner of a Roth IRA. The sole beneficiary of her Roth IRA is her daughter Sarah who was 56 at the time for Sylvia's death. Had this been a traditional IRA, the required distribution rules applicable to death after the required beginning date would be used. However, since this is a Roth IRA, the rules that are used are the same rules that govern required distributions from traditional IRAs where the owner dies before the required beginning date. Thus, the daughter's required distributions will be based upon either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The "five year" rule.</p>
</li>
<li>The life expectancy of the daughter, determined by her attained age in the year after her mother's death.</li>
</ul>
