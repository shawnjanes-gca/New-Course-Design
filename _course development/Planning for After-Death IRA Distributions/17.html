  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Owner's Death ON or AFTER the RBD (With a Designated Beneficiary) - Non-Spouse Beneficiary</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>According to IRS guidelines, the distribution options for a non-spouse beneficiary are as follows.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  	<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Distribution Options for Non-Spouse Beneficiary</strong></p>
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>RMDs based on the non-spouse beneficiary's single life expectancy</strong>
			<p>The RMDs for the beneficiary would be calculated in the year following the year of the IRA owner's death.  The life expectancy factor is determined from the IRS Single Life Table by using the beneficiary's attained age in the year after the year of the IRA owner's death.  Rather than annually returning to the Single Life Table, this life expectancy factor is then reduced by one for each subsequent year.  Payments under this method must start no later than December 31 of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death.</p>
         </li>
         <li><strong>RMDs where the beneficiary is older than the IRA owner</strong>
			<p>If the designated beneficiary was older than the deceased IRA owner at the time of death, RMDs may be based on the deceased IRA owner's remaining single life expectancy.  This will result in a smaller RMD amount if the beneficiary was more than a year older.  The remaining life expectancy is determined as of the deceased owner's birthday in the year of death and reduced by one each subsequent year after death.</p>
         </li>
         <li><strong>If Multiple beneficiaries</strong>
			<p>If more than one designated beneficiary is named, then the longer of the life expectancy of the oldest beneficiary or the deceased owner's remaining life expectancy is used (unless separate accounts are established by December 31 of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
