  <p>While IRAs are not necessarily the primary vehicle for wealth accumulation, many clients today have significant wealth in these tax-deferred accounts as a result of rollovers from qualified plans. It is, therefore, important that financial services professionals be knowledgeable regarding IRA opportunities, strategies, and current regulations.</p>
  <p>At the core, the regulations governing IRAs are designed to accomplish two primary objectives: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Simplicity in the regulations governing distributions from these vehicles.</li>
    <li>Flexibility for the participant/IRA owner in making and planning for choices regarding       distributions after their death. </li>
  </ul>
