  </h1>
  <p>If the IRA owner dies on or after the Required Beginning Date (RBD), then any Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) that had yet to be removed by the owner for the year of death must be removed by the beneficiary(ies) prior to the end of that year. Beginning with the year after death, the options for the beneficiaries are somewhat different than they were if death occurred before the owner reached the RBD.</p>
  <p>Similar to the previous discussion, there are three potential beneficiary designations that are considered.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Single Individual</li>
    <li>Multiple Individuals</li>
    <li>Entities (Trusts, charities or the like)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will detail each beneficiary and the options they have on the following pages.</p>
