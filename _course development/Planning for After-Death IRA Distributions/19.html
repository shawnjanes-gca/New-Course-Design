  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Owner's Death ON or AFTER the RBD (Without a Designated Beneficiary)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>If there are no designated beneficiaries upon the death of the IRA owner, as would occur in naming an entity that does not satisfy the "look through" rules, only one distribution option is available.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  	<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Distribution Option with No Designated Beneficiary</strong></p>
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>RMDs based on the deceased IRA owner's remaining single life expectancy</strong>
<p>After the IRA owner's death, the spouse can roll over or transfer the assets to his or her own IRA.  The spouse can then name new beneficiaries.  Also, if the spouse is under age 70Â½, annual distributions can be delayed until his or her Required Beginning Date.</p>
			<p>If there are no designated beneficiaries, the IRA balance must be distributed over the IRA owner's remaining single life expectancy.  This is obtained from the IRS Single Life Table by using the IRA owner's attained age in the year of death, and is reduced by one for each subsequent year.  These distributions must begin by December 31 of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
 <p>If the entity is a trust that meets certain criteria ("look through" rules), then the beneficiary of that trust is the designated beneficiary for calculating RMDs.  If there are multiple trust beneficiaries, you cannot use separate accountings for each beneficiary; rather, you must go to the multiple individuals (no separate accounts) options, which for deaths occurring on or after RBD would mean selecting distributions based on the LONGER of the oldest beneficiary's single life expectancy or the deceased owner's remaining single life expectancy.</p>
