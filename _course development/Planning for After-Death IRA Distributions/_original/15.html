</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition</strong> - This is the date by which required minimum distributions must begin. It is April 1 of the calendar year following the year the IRA owner attains age 70&frac12;.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong> - The owner must make the initial Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) by this date. Whether the owner's death is before, on, or after this date changes the distribution options available to beneficiaries.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition</strong> - This is the date when beneficiaries are determined for an IRA. It is September 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the IRA owner died.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong> - This is the date by which it is determined whether the IRA owner's beneficiaries are designated beneficiaries.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>"Five-Year Rule"</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition</strong> - This is an after-death distribution methodology whereby all assets in the IRA must be completely distributed to the IRA beneficiary(ies) as of December 31 of the calendar year that contains the fifth anniversary of the date of the IRA owner's death.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong> - This rule is only used if death occurs BEFORE the RBD. This rule must be followed if there are no designated beneficiaries; it is optional in all other situations.</p>
</div>

<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_4" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>"Single Life Expectancy Rule"</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition</strong> - This is an after-death distribution option whereby the IRA proceeds are paid to the appropriate beneficiary(ies) based on the beneficiary's(ies') life expectancy. If only one individual is the beneficiary, it utilizes the single life expectancy of that beneficiary; if multiple individuals are the beneficiaries, it uses the single life expectancy of the oldest beneficiary (unless separate accounts are established by December 31 of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death).</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong> - It may be more advantageous for the beneficiaries to establish separate accounts and receive RMDs based on each beneficiary's own life expectancy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_5" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Separate Accounts</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">

<p><strong>Definition</strong> - When an IRA owner dies and multiple beneficiaries are designated, separate accounts may be established for each beneficiary, thereby providing each beneficiary more flexibility to determine the distribution methodology.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong> - The accounts must be established by December 31 of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death, with funding based on each individual's pro-rata share of the inheritance, and should provide for separate accounting of all gains and losses for each account. Choosing this strategy, each individual is allowed the flexibility to calculate their distribution alternatives separately under the rules established for a single person beneficiary.</p>
