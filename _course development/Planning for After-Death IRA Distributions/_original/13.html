<h2>Postmortem Planning (Owner's Death Before the RBD)</h2>

<p>Between the time of the owner's death and the Determination Date, there is the possibility of postmortem (after death) planning that can enhance the tax-deferred benefit of the IRA. Essentially, there are three ways in which postmortem planning can affect the calculation of the required distributions.</p>

<p>When multiple beneficiaries are named and the beneficiary designation provides for the creation of separate accounts, using separate accounts can enhance the tax-deferral benefit. Creating separate accounts by December 31 of the year after the year of the IRA owner's death allows each beneficiary to take annual RMDs based on his or her own single life expectancy. This is useful in cases where there is a discrepancy between the ages of the beneficiaries. However, separate accounts cannot be used if one of the beneficiaries on the Determination Date is an entity that does not satisfy the "look through" rules.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>For those families where the goal is to extend the life of the tax-deferred advantages of the IRA, the older beneficiaries can disclaim all or part of their share of the IRA benefit prior to the Determination Date, leaving it for the younger remaining beneficiaries, or contingent beneficiaries. The rationale for this tactic is that younger beneficiaries have a longer life expectancy, which would result in a smaller RMD amount, thereby allowing more of the IRA to remain intact and to continue its tax-deferred growth (i.e., "stretching the IRA"). &nbsp;&nbsp;Note that disclaiming treats the disclaiming beneficiary as if he or she has predeceased the IRA owner. The resulting beneficiaries will be determined based on the IRA document, not the disclaiming beneficiary. Therefore, before using this technique it is wise to examine the IRA document for contingent beneficiary identification.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>When there is a mixture of individuals and entities (e.g., charities and trusts) named as beneficiaries, it may be advantageous to make full distribution to the entities prior to the Determination Date. Since these entities may not meet the "look through" rules, the full amount of the IRA would otherwise have to be distributed within 5 years. By making full distribution to the entities prior to the Determination Date, only individuals will be recognized as the designated beneficiaries and the IRA can be distributed according to the life expectancy of the oldest beneficiary or, if separate accounts are created, according to each individual's own life expectancy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mr. Sanford</em></strong></p>
<p>William Sanford had an IRA with a balance of $2.1 million. His wife, Judy, is 72 and is his named designated beneficiary. His children, David and Lauren, are the contingent beneficiaries, and would have been the designated beneficiaries if Judy had already died.</p>
<p>William died of a heart attack on January 15, 2013. Under the RMD rules, the designated beneficiaries are determined on September 30, 2014. If Judy has other assets available to her and does not need the IRA assets for her financial stability, she may want to consider disclaiming her share and allowing the assets to be passed to the children as the contingent beneficiaries. When the Determination Date arrives, the children will be recognized as the designated beneficiaries and the payout will be based on their longer life expectancy. Furthermore, if separate accounts are used, David and Lauren may take distributions based on each individual life expectancy. This will significantly slow the rate at which the assets are removed.</p>
