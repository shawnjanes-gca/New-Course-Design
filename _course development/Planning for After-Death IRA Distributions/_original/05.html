<p>Before addressing the new rules regarding post-death distributions from an IRA, it is important to make sure that two key terms related to the regulations are clearly understood.</p>
<h4>Designated Beneficiary</h4>
<p>Any individual or entity (such as a trust or charity) can be named as beneficiary of an IRA, but not all beneficiary choices will qualify as a "<strong><em>designated beneficiary</em></strong>."&nbsp; Only a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;">natural person</a></strong></span> can qualify as a designated beneficiary. If none is named by the owner, then the IRA plan agreement may name a default beneficiary who may qualify.</p>

<p>The choice of beneficiary and whether or not that choice qualifies as a designated beneficiary will affect the timing of the distribution of the assets after the IRA owner's death. By naming a beneficiary that qualifies as a designated beneficiary, distributions will be based upon a life expectancy factor, which may allow the IRA to be "<strong><em>stretched</em></strong>" out over the beneficiary's life expectancy. However, if the named beneficiary does not qualify as a designated beneficiary, then the potential ability to "stretch" out the life of the IRA is forfeited and the IRA will be subject to income tax sooner rather than later, such as within five years of the IRA owner's death.</p>
<p>Naming an entity, such as a trust, charity, or estate, does not necessarily cause the loss of a designated beneficiary because of what are known as the "look through" rules. These rules, which shall be discussed more thoroughly later in this course, essentially look through the entity to treat the beneficial owner of the entity as the designated beneficiary. Because of the benefit of being able to stretch out the IRA when complying with these rules, special care should be taken when naming any beneficiary who is not an individual so as to preserve the designated beneficiary qualification. There are several requirements to qualify under the "look through" rules, but having only "natural persons" as beneficiaries of the entity is key.</p>
<p>If more than one primary beneficiary is named, each must qualify as a designated beneficiary or the IRA will be treated as having no designated beneficiary. Failure to accomplish this will limit the distribution options available for the IRA.</p>
<p>Naming the beneficiary may seem to be fairly straightforward. However, careful planning should be made when making the selection. For large IRAs, there are often multiple objectives to consider, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Charitable intent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrating the IRA into the overall estate plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximization of the tax deferral opportunities available for the beneficiaries upon the death of the IRA owner (i.e., "stretching" the IRA).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to help clients plan for the most effective use and ultimate distribution of their IRA assets, this module will discuss the implications of the various beneficiary designations that clients typically make and the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
<h4>The "Required Beginning Date"</h4>
<p>The <strong><em>Required Beginning Date</em></strong> <strong><em>(RBD)</em></strong> is the date by which the owner of an IRA must begin making distributions. This does not pertain to ROTH IRA balances as the ROTH is not subject to Required Minimum Distribution rules during the original owner&rsquo;s lifetime. However, for a Traditional IRA, once an IRA owner reaches age 70&frac12;, the IRS requires the owner to annually withdraw a Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). The first of such distributions must be made by the Required Beginning Date (RBD), which is: <strong>April 1 of the calendar year <em>following</em> the calendar year in which the IRA owner reaches the age of 70&frac12;.</strong></p>
