<h2>Owner's Death BEFORE the RBD (With a Designated Beneficiary) - Non-Spouse Beneficiary</h2>
</blockquote>
</td>

<blockquote>
<p>Now that we have examined how final beneficiaries are determined for purposes of computing Required Minimum Distributions (RMD) and how the number of eligible beneficiaries can be reduced for purposes of that computation, we can now look at what happens if the owner dies before the Required Beginning Date (RBD).</p>
<h3>Distribution Options for a Non-Spouse Beneficiary</h3>
According to IRS guidelines, the distribution options for a non-spouse beneficiary are as follows.

<table style="width: 650px;" border="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
<div id="example01">
<p align="center"><strong>Distribution Options for a Non-Spouse Beneficiary </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For a sole designated beneficiary</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The RMDs for the beneficiary would be calculated in the year following the year of the IRA owner's death. The life expectancy factor is determined from the IRS Single Life Table by using the beneficiary's attained age in the year after the year of the IRA owner's death. Thereafter, instead of annually returning to the Single Life Table, this life expectancy factor would simply be reduced by one for each subsequent year. Payments under this method must start no later than December 31 of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>For multiple designated beneficiaries</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If more than one designated beneficiary is named, the life expectancy of the oldest beneficiary is used. However, if separate accounts are established by December 31 of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death, then each separate account would distribute as for a sole designated beneficiary.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The "Five-Year Rule"</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the named beneficiary does not meet the qualifications of a designated beneficiary, the IRA must be fully distributed within five years of the IRA owner's death. Specifically, with the "five-year rule," the entire balance must be fully distributed by the end of the calendar year that contains the fifth anniversary of the date of the IRA owner's death.</p>
<p>If the beneficiary does qualify as a designated beneficiary, the beneficiary can elect to deplete the IRA within five years of the IRA owner's death rather than using one of the methods above.</p>
