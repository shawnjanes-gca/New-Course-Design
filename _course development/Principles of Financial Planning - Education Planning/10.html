  <p>Beginning around 1990, states started developing a new type of plan designed to encourage savings for college expenses. Subsequently, in 1996, legislation was passed giving rise to what has become known as 529 Plans, referring to Internal Revenue Code Section 529, which allows these plans.</p>

                <p>Prepaid Tuition Plans are conceptually similar to defined benefit retirement plans. As the name implies, Prepaid Tuition Plans enable individuals to make contributions to the Plan that will then cover (prepay) expenses for higher education in the future.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>529 Savings Plans provide individuals a tax-advantaged option for saving for college. Savings Plans are conceptually similar to a defined contribution retirement plan. In a 529 Savings Plan, individuals make contributions to the plan and select from the investment options offered.</p>
                <p>The assets can be used in the future to pay for college education expenses. The value of the assets may be more or less than the cost of education, depending upon contributions, growth and cost of the institution selected. </p>

<p>Initially, 529 Plans were not widely publicized; however, they have become an increasingly popular option in the last few years.  Every state now has a 529 Plan. Against the backdrop of traditional funding alternatives, Section 529 Plans are particularly appealing, especially due to higher contribution limits for <a href="#" title="Earnings on 529 plans are free from federal income tax to the extent that withdrawals are used to pay for qualified educational expenses." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">tax-deferred accumulation</a> and greater <a href="#" title="For financial aid purposes, 529 Plans are considered a parental asset." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">donor control over the assets</a> in the account compared to the other vehicles.  529 plans are also attractive because contributions made to a 529 plan at least two years before a federal bankruptcy filing are completely protected from creditors. </p>
