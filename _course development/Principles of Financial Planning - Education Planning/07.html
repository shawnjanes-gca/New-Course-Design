    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Accounts established under UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act), effective in the vast majority of the states, and UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act), effective in relatively few states,, are custodial accounts used to allow minors to have assets titled in their names but managed by an adult.  Upon establishing an UTMA/UGMA, the donor must appoint a custodian who will oversee the account until the minor reaches the age of majority (18 or 21, depending upon the state) at which time the individual gains full control over the assets.</p>
  <p>From a tax perspective, income generated in UTMAs/UGMAs is taxed as unearned income to the minor child. But minors under age 19 and dependent full-time students under age 24 with &ldquo;unearned income&rdquo; above certain levels (adjusted for inflation) are subject to the &ldquo;Kiddie Tax,&rdquo; which may result in taxation at the parent&rsquo;s rate.  Following is an overview of the tax structure for minors who only have unearned income.</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
    <caption>
    <strong><center>2016 KIDDIE TAX TABLE FOR MINORS</center></strong>
    </caption>
    
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><center>First $1,050 of income</center></th>
      <td>0%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><center>Next $1,050 of income</center></th>
      <td>Single Taxpayer rate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><center>Income above $2,100</center></th>
      <td>The higher of the parents&rsquo; top marginal rate or the child&rsquo;s tax rate (&ldquo;Kiddie Tax&rdquo;)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>With this tax structure, UTMAs/UGMAs may be more attractive from a tax perspective than private investment accounts owned by a parent (especially for those with children 19 or older), although the level of benefit depends upon individual circumstances.</p>

            <p>Parents maintain control over the assets in the UTMA/UGMA until the child reaches the age of majority.  At that time, the child assumes full control over the assets in the account, receiving full legal authority to make both investment decisions in the account and distributions for whatever purpose desired.  </p>
This means that the child will assume control of the assets at about the time the child should be in college. The child could then choose to use the money for any purpose, deciding whether to pay for college expenses or to buy a new car or to take an extended European vacation.          </div>

            <p>Transfers to an UTMA/UGMA represent a completed gift and as such may be subject to the Gift Tax.  Therefore, parents are limited to gifts/transfers of $14,000 per year  ($28,000 if the spouse agrees to split the gift) for 2016 (as indexed), per child, if they wish to avoid making a taxable gift and utilizing their unified credit. However, this may no longer be an issue for most people, since each individual is given a lifetime credit against gift and estate taxes that protects the first $5,450,000 (in 2016, as indexed for inflation) of gifts or estate transfers from taxation.</p>
