<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Unlike traditional taxable investment accounts, investment earnings of a 529 Plan are tax-free, provided that the amount distributed from the 529 Plan does not exceed the beneficiary's qualified higher education expenses. The income tax exclusion is also available at the state level for those states that follow the federal tax treatment of 529 Plans.</p>

<p>Qualified distributions from a 529 Plan are free from Federal income taxes. Qualified distributions include tuition, fees, and books at an accredited college or university and expenses for room and board provided that the student is attending school at least on a half-time basis.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 was scheduled to "sunset" effective 12/31/2010, but the Pension Protection Act of 2006 made these plans permanent.</p>

<p>In some states, all or a portion of the contributions by state residents to that state's 529 Plan(s) are state tax deductible or other tax benefits may be available. In some states, the state tax benefits are substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This benefit is not applicable in all states. You should review the provisions of your Plan(s) and you must recommend that clients see a tax advisor to see if this additional tax benefit is applicable.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Less well-known than the income tax benefits of 529 Plans are the Estate and Gift tax benefits. Contributions to 529 Plans are considered a completed gift, meaning the assets are no longer considered part of the contributor's estate. This provision enables higher net worth individuals to use 529 Plans as part of an overall strategy to reduce the size of their estate and, thus, their potential estate tax liability, while still maintaining a high degree of control over the assets (choosing investment options, designating beneficiary, and making withdrawals).</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_5" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Accelerated Gift Tax Treatment</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Individuals making contributions to a 529 Plan can elect to receive accelerated gift tax treatment, enabling them to make the equivalent of 5 years of gift tax-free transfers in one year. In 2015 (as indexed), rather than being limited to $14,000 per beneficiary per year ($28,000 if married and electing to split gifts) without triggering a taxable gift and requiring use of one's unified credit. Individuals can make up to 5 years of contributions in a lump sum (up to $70,000 per beneficiary for single contributors and $140,000 for married contributors) without incurring a taxable gift.</p>
<p>One caveat to making this election is if total contributions to each beneficiary exceeds five times the annual gift tax exclusion ($70,000 for single contributors or $140,000 for married contributors), the excess amount is treated as a taxable gift in the year of contribution and will require the payment of gift tax to the extent that the donor has already utilized his or her unified credit amount.</p>
