<p>Why do shrewd advisors need to understand the implications of Social Security for single, divorced, and widowed clients?</p>

<li>
<p>In a seismic shift from two generations ago, 5 of every 10 adults are choosing to remain single<sup>*</sup>.</p>

<p>The popular press gives scant attention to claiming strategies for single workers. While the opportunities for creativity are limited for single workers, you should be aware of at least one. File and Suspend can be viewed as an informal four-year &ldquo;term life insurance policy&rdquo; for single clients.</p>
<p>A single worker reaching normal retirement age may file for and immediately suspend collection of benefits. Now, fast forward until your client is just a few months shy of his or her 70th birthday and unexpectedly needs a large sum of money.</p>
<p>Your client can request a lump sum payment from Social Security for as many suspended months as he or she chooses. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> to see how this approach could generate a lump sum payment of well over $100,000. Noteworthy - This strategy can also be used by married clients.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">Eligible divorced clients</a></strong> may have rights to Social Security benefits on their former spouse&rsquo;s record.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, your divorced client is eligible for benefits even if their former spouse has not claimed benefits.</p>
<p>Your divorced client may receive current monthly benefits on his or her former spouse&rsquo;s record <strong><em>AND</em></strong> simultaneously earn delayed retirement credits on his or her individual record. While that may sound too good to be true, it simply requires the filing of a Restricted Claim at your client&rsquo;s normal retirement age. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">See the power of this approach by clicking <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s">here</a>.</strong></p>

<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Picture this scene from a movie if you will. A recently widowed client is in her advisor&rsquo;s office. She is deeply worried about the loss of her husband&rsquo;s Social Security income, even as she struggles to deal with her grief.</p>
<p>How would she react to a doubling of her monthly Social Security payment?</p>
<p>A spouse with no individual earnings record is entitled to collect a spousal retirement benefit of as much as 50% of the worker spouse&rsquo;s PIA while the worker is alive. But when the worker dies, the surviving spouse may be entitled to a survivors benefit equal to <strong><em>100% of the workers benefit at death</em></strong>.<strong style="color: #ff0000;"> Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="#_S">here</a> for an illustration.</strong></p>
<p>This story illustrates a little understood benefit of delaying the collection of benefits until age 70. Because your widow or widower collects 100% of the benefits you were collecting at death, their survivorship benefits increase when you delay until age 70!</p>
<p>The most dramatic impact is felt when the surviving spouse has no individual record. However, as long as the surviving spouse&rsquo;s record has a significantly lower&nbsp; PIA than that of the deceased spouse, there is potential for a weighty increase in payout. Widows and widowers enjoy a slight age advantage also - survivorship benefits are generally available as early as age 60 (50 if disabled).</p>

<p><strong>Example - Filing a Restricted Claim - Divorced Client </strong></p>
<p>Tom and Katie are divorced. Katie remains unmarried and she meets all five of the criteria listed above.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Katie and Tom are both age 62.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Katie&rsquo;s PIA at her normal retirement age (66) is $1,400.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s PIA at his normal retirement age (66) is $2,600.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Katie has a choice - she can file for retirement benefits on her own record and accept a permanent reduction in her benefits or she can wait until her normal retirement age and file a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits on Tom&rsquo;s record.</p>
<p>The advantages to Katie&rsquo;s filing a Restricted Claim at her age 66 follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She will earn delayed retirement credits on her record of up to 32% (8% per year until age 70).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She will receive a $1,300 monthly spousal benefit on Tom&rsquo;s record from her age 66 until her age 70. Noteworthy - this is only $100/month less than the benefit she could collect if claiming on her own record during this same 4-year period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should file for benefits on her record at her age 70, generating a monthly income for life of about $1,850.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What just happened as a result of Katie&rsquo;s filing a Restricted Claim?</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>She receives a $5,400 annual raise <strong><em>for life</em></strong> by waiting until age 70 to claim her own benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Katie&rsquo;s cost in securing this lifetime annual raise is a mere $4,800; the $100 per month she gave up from her age 66 to age 70.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She receives over $62,000 in &ldquo;free&rdquo; spousal benefits on Tom&rsquo;s record ($1,300 per month for the 4 years from age 66 through age 70).</p>

<p>Mr. Jonathan and Mrs. Mary Small are your clients. They are both age 74 and have been married for 40 years. Jonathan is collecting a retirement benefit of $2,800 per month on his record and Mary is collecting a spousal retirement benefit on his record of $1,400 per month.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Jonathan was killed yesterday in a Class V whitewater rafting mishap. Mary is now entitled to a survivorship benefit of $2,800 per month (plus cost-of-living adjustments) for the rest of her life.</p>
