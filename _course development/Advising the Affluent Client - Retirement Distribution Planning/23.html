              <p>How does “free college funding” sound? While this will not be possible for all clients, here is a great way to fund college in second marriages for which there is a significant difference in spousal ages. Join us as we illustrate by example.</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box">
              	<h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Assume John is 66 (his normal retirement age) and Lynn is 45.</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>This is John’s second marriage and Lynn’s first marriage. The have one child named Pauline. Pauline just celebrated her 11th birthday.</li>
                    <li>Neither John nor Lynn has other children. John claimed and is now receiving Social Security retirement benefits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here is what you need to know:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Pauline is generally entitled to as much as 50% of John’s benefit until she reaches age 18. </li>
                    <li>Pauline could collect over $100,000* in benefits over the next 7 years.</li>
                </ul>
				<footer>
				  <div class="footertext"></div>
				  <!-- footertext -->
				  <p>*Depending upon John’s PIA.</p>
			    </footer>
              </div>
<p><strong><em>But wait, there is more!</em></strong></p>
              <p>Lynn has rights also. In an earlier discussion, we revealed that spousal benefits on the worker’s record could generally be paid only if the worker’s spouse was at least age 62. By that standard, Lynn would not be eligible for a spousal benefit on John’s record for another 17 years (from her age 45 to age 62). </p>
              <p>You have great news for Lynn. There is an exception to the general rule - a spouse of the worker who is caring for a child of the worker may collect a spousal benefit until the child reaches age 16. Therefore, Lynn (age 45) may claim a spousal benefit on John’s record for the next five years (until Pauline reaches age 16). </p>

              <p>Federal law, including Social Security regulations, recognizes spousal rights of legally married same gender couples: the spouses are entitled to the same rights and benefits accorded to legally married heterosexual spouses. As a result of a 2015 Supreme Court decision, all states must permit same gender couples to legally marry.</p>
