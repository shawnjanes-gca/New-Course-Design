    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Your focus on managing distributions from qualified plans will help you identify opportunities for annuity and rollover solutions for clients whose needs may not be fully met from qualified plans. Qualified plan distributions are made out to be far more complex than they really are. The options listed below represent the most commonly available choices and requirements:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Lump sum distribution</li>
	<li>Alternative distributions from Defined Benefit Plans</li>
	<li>Alternative distributions from other qualified plans </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Be aware that individual qualified plans vary. Your client should contact their qualified plan administrator to clarify which choices are available.  For example, plans such as Defined Benefit Plans, Cash Balance Plans, and Money Purchase plans generally prohibit distributions to active employees before age 62.</p>
  <p>It has been said that qualified plan distributions are more difficult to understand than nuclear physics, yet that need not be the case! Join us as we help demystify these options by clicking each of the following:  Click each option to learn more.</p>

              <p>If permitted by the plan document, lump sum distributions are generally permitted from qualified plans.</p>
              <p>A client seeking absolute control over qualified plan funds may be attracted to a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;The IRS defines a lump sum distribution from a qualified plan as “the distribution or payment, within a single tax year, of a plan participant's entire balance from all of the employer's qualified plans…” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lump sum distribution may be in cash or in kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A cash distribution is simply a check made payable to the participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An in kind distribution is the distribution of securities owned in the account rather than cash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">lump sum distribution</a> of his or her <a href="#" title="Vesting refers to the process of the participant’s earning non-forfeitable rights to employer plan contributions and earnings thereon." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">vested </a><a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_3" class="p7TTM_trg" title="The <em>account balance</em> is simply the value of a client’s account in a defined contribution category plan, such as a 401(k) Plan. ">account balance</a> or vested <a href="#" title="The &lt;em&gt;accrued benefit&lt;/em&gt; is the monthly benefit available to the participant in a defined benefit category plan, such as a Traditional Defined Benefit Plan. An actuarial calculation is required to determine the lump sum payable." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">accrued benefit</a> at retirement. However, extreme caution must be exercised in two areas: 1) if the plan is a <a href="#" title="&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defined Benefit Plans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; include Traditional Defined Benefit Plans and Fully Insured Defined Benefit Plans. The most important qualified plans, including defined benefit plans, were discussed in the previous course “Advising the Affluent Client: Retirement Accumulation Planning.”" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">defined benefit plan</a>, the guaranteed monthly pension payments are lost in exchange for the lump sum; and 2) taxes must be managed carefully to avoid a huge income tax bill.</p>
              <p>When is a lump sum distribution taxable and when is it tax-deferred?</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>If the participant receives the lump sum into a personal account such as a brokerage account or checking account, the distribution is taxable in the year received. This is seldom the wisest choice because income taxes will be due in the year of distribution for the entire taxable distribution</li>
                <li>Participants choosing to rollover or directly transfer a lump sum distribution to an IRA, <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;An IRA established simply to hold qualified plan balances might be referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rollover IRA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rollover IRAs are frequently used when a participant does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;strong&gt; intend to transfer the funds back to a qualified plan of another employer. A rollover IRA may be seen more frequently at retirement rather than during a client’s working career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that there are only two basic types of IRA, Traditional or Roth. A rollover IRA is NOT a separate category of IRA: it is merely the use of an IRA to hold former qualified plan assets over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_6">Rollover IRA</a> or <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Conduit IRA&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is established solely to receive a lump sum distribution from a qualified plan so that the plan participant has the option to rollover the funds to another qualified plan. The Conduit IRA may be more frequently used during a client’s lifetime than at retirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Conduit IRA is NOT a separate category of IRA; it is merely the use of a Traditional or Roth IRA to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;temporarily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hold former qualified plan assets until they can be transferred to another employer’s qualified plan.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_7">Conduit IRA</a> may defer taxation until future taxable distributions are taken. This is generally the most tax efficient means of taking a lump sum distribution.</li>

    			<div class="example-box"><h3 style="color:red;">Beware the 20% Withholding Trap!</h3><p>Note that any distributions paid directly to the plan participant are subject to <strong>mandatory</strong> 20% federal tax withholding. Only a direct transfer of funds from a qualified plan to another qualified plan or IRA will avoid the 20% withholding tax. Additional insights into rollovers and direct transfers follow subsequently in this course.</p>

              <p>Defined Benefit Plans* for our purposes in this discussion include Traditional Defined Benefit Plans, Fully Insured Defined Benefit Plans, and DB/k Plans.</p>
			  <p>Instead of a lump sum distribution, a participant may choose to take the accrued benefit offered by the plan or use the present value of the accrued benefit to purchase an annuity. </p>
			  <p>Your client may be attracted to the accrued benefit payable from a Defined Benefit Plan for the following reasons:</p>
              	<ul>
                	<li>Monthly payments that are guaranteed for life</li>
                    <li>Protection from most personal creditors in the event of personal bankruptcy</li>
                </ul>
              <p>An annuity purchased from a financial services company (as opposed to monthly  payments from the qualified plan itself) may appeal to clients placing a high value on the following:</p>
              	<ul>
                	<li>Potential to increase rate of investment return and/or total payout</li>
                    <li>Ability to structure the annuity in ways not offered by the qualified plan</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Be aware that an annuity may be purchased by the plan administrator directly through the participant’s plan on behalf of your client (not available in all plans) or directly by your client from a financial services company through a Rollover IRA.</p>
              <p>The use of a Rollover IRA allows for continued income tax deferral of earnings as opposed to the immediate recognition of income required in lump sum distributions.  Rollovers and transfers are discussed in greater detail subsequently in this course.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Which to choose: lump sum or annuity?  </em></strong>The answer to this question involves a review of the distribution options stated in the qualified plan, an analysis of the participant’s retirement needs, as well as a calculation of the tax consequences for each option.</p>
              	<ul>
                	<li>A key factor is investment return. Will the participant earn a higher return by taking the lump sum distribution and investing it elsewhere or would be the participant enjoy higher returns by leaving the money in the plan?</li>
                    <li>This decision involves both financial and non-financial issues. For example, what value does a participant place upon the freedom to use the funds as he or she chooses?  Is it worthwhile to pay the taxes in a lump sum distribution to gain full access to the after-tax funds?  Is the participant engaged in a high-risk occupation that makes civil suits likely?  If suits are likely, the creditor protection accorded funds in qualified plans may be an important consideration.*</li>
