<p>The spouse of a worker may collect a spousal benefit on the worker&rsquo;s <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>record</strong></a> even if the worker&rsquo;s spouse has never worked outside of the home. A spousal benefit can only be collected if the worker has claimed a benefit. The spousal benefit can be as high as 50% of the worker&rsquo;s PIA if both spouses are of normal retirement age. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example.</strong> However, if spousal benefits are claimed before normal retirement age, the 50% benefit is reduced dramatically.</p>
<p>The spouse must be at least age 62 <strong><em>or</em></strong> caring for an <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>eligible child</strong></a> to collect a spousal benefit. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example.</strong></p>
<p>How are spousal benefits calculated if the worker&rsquo;s spouse worked outside of the home and has an individual record? Social Security pays a benefit to the spouse based upon his or her individual record first and then, to the extent a spousal benefit is greater, pays an additional amount as a spousal benefit. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer5','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example.</strong></p>

<p>Samuel can collect spousal benefits on Kitty&rsquo;s record if he is at least age 62. It would be better for him to wait until his normal retirement age to file for spousal benefits because his benefit would be be significantly larger.</p>
