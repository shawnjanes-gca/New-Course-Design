<p>You client just stated, &ldquo;I am very concerned about running out of money before I die, but I need a pool of capital for emergencies.&rdquo; While there are a number of sources for a lifetime income stream (qualified plan, annuity, and Social Security), those sources may not always provide a ready pool of capital for your client&rsquo;s emergency use.</p>
<p>What if there was a way to receive a lifetime income stream <strong>and</strong> keep an emergency pool of capital for lifetime use or, at death, fund a legacy?</p>
<p>We present the safe withdrawal rate for your consideration. A withdrawal rate from a portfolio is considered a &ldquo;safe withdrawal rate&rdquo; if it can be withdrawn over a client&rsquo;s lifetime, including adjustments for inflation, <strong><em>without depleting the portfolio</em></strong>. The safe withdrawal rate was considered about 4% by many over the last two decades*. This rate was considered safe because the portfolio return was assumed to equal 4% plus inflation. This concept is best illustrated by example.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Patricia needs an inflation-adjusted pretax income stream of $30,000 annually from her portfolio to supplement her other retirement income sources.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Her portfolio must have a minimum value of $750,000 based upon a 4% withdrawal rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The portfolio value is calculated as $30,000 divided by 4%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patricia may withdraw an inflation-adjusted $30,000 for the remainder of her life, no matter how long she lives, assuming a portfolio return equaling at least 4% plus inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patricia&rsquo;s heirs will receive a portfolio valued at $750,000 at her death.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Generalizations about the safe return are just that - generalizations. The 4% safe rate may not indeed be safe for conservative investors in low interest rate markets&dagger;. So what is the solution? One approach is to factor in retirement age, asset allocation, inflation assumptions, legacy goals and lifespan into the recommendation of a truly safe withdrawal rate.&nbsp; The calculation of a safe withdrawal rate may use a number of methods, including <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>capital preservation</strong></a>, <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>capital exhaustion</strong></a>, or a <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>hybrid</strong></a> of the two.</p>

<h4>Capital Preservation</h4>
<p><strong><em>Capital preservation</em></strong> is literally the preservation of the entire capital pool (portfolio) by distributing only the return from the portfolio. At your client&rsquo;s death, the entire value of the portfolio remains available for distribution to heirs or charities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The dramatic advantage is an income stream that simply cannot be outlived. Your client can never run out of money in a capital preservation distribution method.<strong> </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equally dramatic disadvantage is that more capital, much more capital, is required for this method than the Capital Exhaustion or Hybrid methods. <strong> </strong></p>
</li>

<h4>Capital Exhaustion</h4>
<p><strong><em>Capital Exhaustion</em></strong> is what your client is describing when he or she says &ldquo;I want to die exactly at the date I run out of money and I want the check to the undertaker to bounce.&rdquo;</p>
The monstrous risk is that she may be wrong about her date of death and outlive her money. The attraction of this method is that it requires far less capital than the capital preservation method. Capital Exhaustion is also referred to as Capital Depletion.

<h4>Hybrid Method</h4>
<p>The <strong><em>Hybrid Method </em></strong>may give your client the best of both worlds and includes characteristics of Capital Preservation and Capital Exhaustion. For example, a distribution plan designed to provide income until age 100 with a $250,000 remaining portfolio balance results in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Less capital required than Capital Preservation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less risk of running out of money than Capital Exhaustion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to an emergency pool of capital during life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater probability of leaving a financial legacy to heirs</p>
</li>
