  <div class="example-box" ><h3 style="color:red;">Legislative Alert</h3><p>The Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2015, signed into law November 2015, severely curtailed two creative claiming strategies. One of those strategies, File and Suspend, remains available for qualifying clients until April 30, 2016. The second strategy, Filing a Restricted Claim, remains available for clients reaching age 62 by December 31, 2015. The dialogue that follows analyzes how these strategies have customarily worked and how they are impacted by the BBA of 2015.</p> </div>

  <p>Before the BBA of 2015, a <a href="#" title="Purely for purposes of the Social Security discussion in this course, we define a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;traditional  married couple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as two heterosexual spouses of approximately the same age in a long-term, legally-wedded union. This distinction is made so that we may subsequently share strategies for other couples, such as those in a second family or same gender marriage." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">traditional married couple</a> could have found as much as $60,000 or more in “free money” merely by separating the claiming date from the collection date. This feat was accomplished through two creative claiming strategies: (1) File and Suspend and (2) Filing a Restricted Claim. In the discussion that follows, we illustrate these sophisticated concepts through a series of straightforward examples. You may be reminded of specific clients or prospects as you consider the examples.</p>
  <p>Our analysis in this section of the course focuses on three types of traditional married couple. Click each to learn more.</p>

              <p>Before the BBA of 2015, the File and Suspend election was  ideal for marriages in which only one spouse worked outside of the home, the  spouses were about the same age, and the wage-earning spouse wished to work  until age 70. </p>
              <p>File and Suspend was a windfall for many and here is how it  worked: the worker <strong>filed</strong> for (claimed)  benefits and then immediately suspended collection of those benefits. </p>
              <p>There were at least two potentially lucrative reasons to  elect File and Suspend: </p>
              <ol>
                <li><span>Qualified the worker's spouse to receive  spousal benefits on the worker's record, and </span></li>
                <li><span>Earned delayed retirement credits on the  worker's record.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>As you consider this concept, remember that spousal benefits  generally could only be paid if the worker had <em>claimed</em> benefits. Below is an example to see how this  powerful election once generated as much as $60,000 in "free" benefits.</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box">
              	<h3>Example - Free $60,000</h3>
                <p>Your clients Fred and Farrah Franklin, both aged 66, look to you for financial advice.</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Neither Fred nor Farrah have claimed or collected Social Security retirement benefits previously. Farrah has been the sole breadwinner while Fred has not worked outside of the home. Age 66 is their normal retirement age.</li>
                    <li>Farrah’s monthly retirement check, calculated on her own record, would be $2,500 if she filed and began collecting benefits at age 66. However, the allure of a permanent increase of 32% to her monthly retirement check has motivated Farrah to delay retirement until age 70. </li>
                </ul>
                 <p>The couple could use additional cash flow for the next four years, but there is a problem. Fred has no record upon which he may claim his own Social Security retirement benefits and, under the general spousal benefit rules, <strong>he is not eligible for a spousal benefit on Farrah’s record until she files for her own benefits.</strong></p>
                 <p>How do they get the cash flow they need for the next four years?</p>
                 <ul>
                 	<li>Farrah can file for retirement benefits on her own record and immediately suspend the collection of her benefits. Because Farrah has now filed, Fred may now file a claim for spousal benefits on his wife’s record. </li>
                    <li>He will immediately begin receiving spousal Social Security retirement benefit checks of $1,250 monthly, plus cost-of-living adjustments. Meanwhile, Farrah earns an annual 8% delayed retirement credit to her own benefit until her age 70. </li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>The net result is a beautiful thing.</p>
                 <ul>
                 	<li>Fred collects $60,000 in free money (48 months @ $1,250 per month) from spousal benefits. </li>
                    <li>If that were not enough, Farrah’s retirement benefit jumps from $30,000 annually at age 66 to nearly $40,000 at age 70! This represents a 32% raise courtesy of her delayed retirement credit.</li>
                 </ul>

              </div>
              
              <p>The  File and Suspend Strategy was virtually eliminated by the BBA of 2015. <strong><em>File  and Suspend is now available for new filings only if your client has reached  full retirement age AND files and suspends by April 30, 2016.</em></strong> Those  clients previously filing and suspending are grandfathered in under the  previous law and will not lose file and suspend benefits.</p>

              <p>Filing a Restricted Claim is most effective for two-income marriages in which one spouse has a significantly higher PIA than the other spouse, the primary wage-earner wishes to collect benefits at normal retirement age, and there is a desire for the lesser earning spouse to collect spousal benefits.</p>
              <p>A Restricted Claim allows one spouse (generally the lesser earning spouse) to choose between collecting retirement benefits on her own record OR collecting spousal benefits on her husband’s record. </p>
              <p>Either husband or wife can use this strategy.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>For example, assume Jack and Jill are married. Jill is the primary wage earner and Jack earns less. When Jack applies for retirement benefits, he is deemed to apply for benefits on his own record unless he specifies otherwise. Jack can specify otherwise and avoid the “deeming” trap by filing a claim that is restricted to only his spousal benefits on Jill’s record. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Below is an example of how this strategy may add up to $70,000 or more in lifetime retirement income.</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example - Filing a Restrictedx Claim</h3>
                <p>Mrs. Sarah and Mr. Charles Magnussen are your clients. They are each 66 years of age (their normal retirement age). Both spouses were wage earners, yet Charles was the primary breadwinner. Both Sarah and Charles were born before 1953.</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Charles filed for retirement benefits on his record immediately upon reaching age 66. He will receive monthly checks of 100% of his PIA of $2,500.</li>
                    <li>Sarah’s PIA on her own record at age 66 is $1,275.</li>
                    <li>Sarah has a filing choice - she can receive $1,275 monthly by filing a claim for retirement benefits on her record or receive a 50% spousal benefit ($1,250) monthly by filing a restricted claim for spousal benefits on Charles’ record. </li>

                </ul>
                <p>Counter-intuitively, Sarah should file a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits of $1,250/month instead of filing for her own benefit of $1,275/month. Here is why:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>She will earn delayed retirement credits of up to 32% (8% per year until her age 70) on her own benefit. Why? She is not taking benefits from her own record; she is taking spousal benefits from Charles’ record. </li>
                    <li>Because of the delayed retirement credits, her retirement benefit on her own record will grow to almost $1,700 per month (132% of $1,275) by her age 70. </li>
                    <li>At age 70, Sarah should file for retirement benefits on her own record.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>The net result is dramatic.</p>
                 <ul>
                 	<li>Sarah will gain over $400 per month for life ($4,900 annually) beginning at age 70 as a result of the delayed credits. If she lives until age 85, she will have gained over $73,000! </li>
                    <li>What is her cost? Her only cost is the $25 per month she will give up from age 66 until age 70. That is a total cost of only $1,200 (48 months at $25/month). </li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>The dramatic net result is produced because Sarah collects only spousal benefits restricted to Charles’ record. </p>
                 <ul>
                 	<li>She is NOT required to collect any benefits from her own individual record.</li>
                    <li>As a result, Sarah receives a substantial income stream for four full years from Charles’ record while earning delayed retirement credits on her own record.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
  					<div class="example-box" ><h3 style="color:red;">Cautionary Example</h3><p>Kayla and Drew are married.  They have both worked their entire career and Kayla's PIA is significantly  higher.  Drew may file a Restricted Claim  for spousal benefits as soon as he reaches normal retirement age. <strong><em>A Restricted Claim for spousal benefits may  not be filed before normal retirement age</em></strong>
</p>
				<p>If Drew files for spousal benefits before normal retirement age, his claim is automatically paid from his own record. He is forever barred from filing a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits on Kayla’s record. </p>
    </div>
    <!-- example-box -->
  </p>
  				<p><strong>The BBA of 2015 impacted the Restricted Claim strategy - only those clients reaching age 62 by December 31, 2015 (born before 1953), are eligible for the strategy.</strong> Such individuals may subsequently file a restricted claim for spousal benefits when they reach full retirement age.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, individuals filing a Restricted Claim before enactment of the BBA of 2015 are grandfathered in under the old laws and will not lose their Restricted Claim benefits.</p>

              <p>Here is an intriguing strategy for financially successful couples in which each spouse has high earnings. For such couples, the combination of File and Suspend with filing a Restricted Claim can leverage Social Security retirement benefits to unprecedented heights.</p>
              <p>The combination approach works best for married clients of approximately the same age with high individual PIAs. Clients fitting this profile may enjoy Social Security retirement benefits as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><span>Husband earns delayed credits on his individual record,</span> </li>
                <li><span>Wife earns delayed credits on her individual record, and </span></li>
              	<li><span>Wife* collects  free spousal benefits on husband's record beginning at her NRA.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>Here is the seismic takeaway: <strong>both spouses are earning delayed retirement credits AND simultaneously one spouse is receiving current spousal benefits!</strong></p>
              <p> The combination approach is best illustrated by example. </p>

              <div class="explanation-widget-box">
              	<h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Perry and Marilyn Gregson are your clients. They are age 66 (their normal retirement age). Neither Perry nor Marilyn have claimed or collected Social Security retirement benefits previously. Perry’s PIA is $2,600 and Marilyn’s PIA equals $2,000. Perry plans to work until age 70 to earn delayed retirement credits but Marilyn wishes to stop working now. They need income to replace a portion of Marilyn’s income from employment. </p>
                <p>Here is what happens next in the combination strategy.</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Perry claims and suspends the benefit on his record in the current year (his age 66, his NRA). He earns delayed retirement credits because his benefits are suspended.</li>
                    <li>Marilyn files a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits on Perry’s record.</li>
                    <li>Marilyn earns delayed retirement credits on her record because she has not filed for benefits on her record.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>Assume that Perry and Marilyn wait until age 70 to claim and collect benefits on their individual record.  The financial results follow.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Marilyn receives spousal benefits on Perry’s record of over $62,000 (50% of Perry’s PIA for the four years from age 66 through age 70).</li>
                    <li>Perry’s annual retirement benefit grows by about $10,000 <strong>for life</strong> as a result of his delayed retirement credits (32% of his age 66 benefit).</li>
                    <li>Marilyn’s annual retirement benefit grows by about $8,000 <strong>for life</strong> as a result of her delayed retirement credits (32% of her age 66 benefit). </li>
