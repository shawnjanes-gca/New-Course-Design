  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Slashing Income Taxes with Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>What if you could save $20,000 or more in income taxes for your client? Your awareness of the net unrealized appreciation (NUA) technique could slash income tax rates by as much as 20%. On a $100,000 distribution, that saves as much as <strong>$20,000</strong>. Here is how it works.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Taxable distributions from qualified plans are generally taxed at ordinary income tax rates, with precious few exceptions.</li>
    <li>A quirk in the tax code allows (if not incents) employers and participants to invest in employer securities. Depending upon qualified plan type, the plan may invest from 10% to 100% of plan assets into employer securities.</li>
    <li>The NUA of those employer securities may be taxed at long-term capital gains rates instead of ordinary income tax rates as long we <a href="#" title="&lt;h3&gt;Dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s for NUA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a qualified plan makes a lump sum distribution that includes employer stock, the &lt;strong&gt;unrealized appreciation&lt;/strong&gt; of the stock is not taxable to the participant at the time of the distribution.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted black; padding: 0px 10px 0px 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unrealized appreciation &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrealized appreciation is the difference between the value of the stock when originally contributed to the plan in the past and the value of the stock when distributed to the participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NUA qualifies for long-term capital gains rates when the participant actually sells the stock, regardless of how long (or short) it is held after the distribution date. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only a &lt;strong&gt;portion&lt;/strong&gt; of the lump sum distribution of employer securities is taxed to the participant at ordinary income tax rates.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted black;padding: 0px 10px 0px 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Portion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portion taxed at ordinary income tax rates is the value of the stock when originally contributed to the plan by the employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">dot the i’s and cross the t’s</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your primary role here is in helping your client work with the qualified plan administrator to identify potential NUA opportunities. From there, a follow-up with a CPA, Tax Counsel, or a CFP® certificant is suggested. Below is a detailed NUA example.</p>
  <div><em class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>NUA Example</h3>
  	<p>Jack Hogan was a participant in the Aztec Industries Profit Sharing Plan. He did not contribute to the plan.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>He terminated employment at age 60 and a few weeks later the plan distributed 1,000 shares of Aztec stock to him with a current market value of $44,000. </li>
        <li>The cumulative value of the contributions by the company attributable to the 1,000 shares of stock was $14,000. The net unrealized appreciation was $30,000 ($44,000 current market value less $14,000 value of employer contributions).</li>
        <li>The plan also distributed $50,000 in cash to Jack, thus the total distribution was $94,000. </li>
        <li>The distributions qualify as a lump sum distribution.</li>
        <li>Jack is in a 28% marginal federal tax bracket for ordinary income tax purposes and a 15% bracket for capital gains tax purposes.</li>
    </ul>
     <p><strong>What are Jack’s income tax options regarding the distribution?</strong></p>
     	<ol>
        	<li><span>Pay ordinary income tax on the entire distribution – His total income tax bill will be $26,320 (28% of 94,000). No premature distribution penalty will apply because he is older than age 59½.</span></li>
            <li><span>Pay capital gains tax on the NUA and pay ordinary income tax on the rest – His total income tax bill will be $22,420. This approach saves $3,900 in tax versus option 1. Click <a href="#" title="&lt;table style=&quot; border:1px;&quot;&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Option 2 Tax Calculation&lt;/caption&gt;
    
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;15% capital gains tax on $30,000 NUA&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$  4,500&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28% ordinary income tax on the $14,000 employer contribution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$  3,920&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28% ordinary income tax on the $50,000 in cash&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$14,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total tax – Option 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$22,420&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">here</a> for the calculation.</span></li>
		<li><span>Pay capital gains tax on the NUA and rollover the cash to a Rollover IRA – This approach captures long-term capital gains rates on the NUA and defers ordinary income tax to the greatest extent possible. The current income tax cost would be $8,420 (15% of the NUA of $30,000 plus 28% of the $14,000 employer contributions). Income tax on the $50,000 in cash would be deferred until funds are distributed from the Rollover IRA.</span></li>
        <li><span>Rollover the entire $94,000 distribution into a Rollover IRA – This approach defers taxes until future distribution. However, he will lose long-term capital gains rates on the NUA under this approach. All distributions from the Rollover IRA will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates.</span></li>
     </ol>
<p>Careful calculations by a tax professional, assuming a variety of options, will assist in the client’s decision-making process that invariably must also take into consideration a number of personal, financial and estate planning objectives and concerns.</p>
