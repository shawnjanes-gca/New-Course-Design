  <p>A lifetime of careful retirement planning can be undone with the wrong age choice. A less-than-ideal retirement planning effort can be vastly improved by the right age choice.</p>
  <p>Choosing the collection age is fully within your client’s control and should contemplate, at a minimum, the factors in the chart below. Click on each factor to learn more.</p>

              <p>The Social Security Administration designs the early retirement, normal retirement, and delayed retirement benefit payments to have approximately equal present values based upon <em><strong>average life expectancy</strong></em>.</p>
              <p>Clients in poor health with short life expectancies may fare better by claiming and collecting benefits as early as possible. Clients with average or better health may be better served by waiting until NRA or age 70. Interestingly enough, the Social Security Administration* confirms that about one-third of all retirees reaching age 65 will live until age 90.</p>
              <p>It is mathematically possible to calculate a breakeven age that balances the expected return from future higher benefits against the cost of giving up benefits today. A retired Social Security administrator analyzes breakeven ages under varying assumptions at the following link: <a href="https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/When%20to%20Start%20Collecting%20Social%20Security%20Benefits%20A%20Break-Even%20Analysis.aspx" target="_blank">Social Security Benefits A Break-Even Analysis</a></p>

              <p>The delayed credits of up to 8% per year were established during a period of near historic highs in fixed income rates of return. The simple question to ask here is, “Will I earn a greater return by taking reduced benefits early and investing the proceeds or will my return be greater if I wait until 70 to claim and collect?” In most market cycles, it’s tough to beat an 8% return guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p>

              <p>The case for delaying until age 70 becomes even stronger when cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) are considered. You are aware that delaying the collection of benefits until age 70 can increase annual benefits by as much as 32% versus collection of benefits at normal retirement age (well over 70% versus collecting at age 62). But the increase is actually even higher as a result of the COLA impact. Here is why:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>The annual COLA is based upon a variation of the Consumer Price Index and is calculated each year beginning with the worker’s age 62. </li>
                <li>COLAs are cumulative and serve to increase PIA even if benefits are collected later than age 62.</li>
                <li>Because the worker’s benefit at age 70 is higher than previous ages, the COLA itself provides more dollars to the worker when benefits are delayed until age 70. </li>
                <li>The annual increase in just the COLA from delaying until age 70 versus taking benefits at age 62 can exceed $1,000* annually.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The joys of delayed claiming and collection of benefits until age 70 may seem unreachable if your client is dead set on early retirement and simply must have cash flow from Social Security retirement benefits.</p>
              <p>
One approach to this challenge is to consider creative claiming strategies and/or other techniques to bridge the income gap until age 70. We will analyze both of these potential solutions later in this course. </p>

              <p>Delayed retirement credits may also serve to increase survivorship benefits at the death of the worker. The surviving spouse of the deceased worker may receive 100% of the benefit being received by the worker at the worker’s death. This impact is not always mentioned in discussions of “breakeven” ages for waiting to claim benefits.</p>
