  <p>You may find yourself advising clients and prospects that were either misinformed or unaware of the planning opportunities contained in this course. A potential, if not common, client angst is the realization that age 62 was NOT a wise claiming age decision. We chronicled the reasons to avoid claiming at age 62 earlier in this course and recall them for you now.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Locks in a lifetime of permanently reduced retirement benefits for the worker</li>
    <li>May lock in a lifetime of permanently reduced survivor benefits for the worker's spouse</li>
    <li>Disqualifies the use of filing a restricted claim for spousal benefits</li>
    <li>May result in reduction of benefits for income earned in excess of thresholds until after normal  retirement age</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All may not be lost; there are two potential fixes. While these fixes may not be as effective as making the right claiming age decision in the first place, they could provide a measure of help. Click on each potential fix to learn more.</p>

            <p>A client gets a once in a lifetime “do over” within the first 12 months after first claiming a retirement benefit. Clients within the 12-month window may repay all benefits received and the claiming age “clock” is reset as if no claim for benefits were filed.</p>

            <p>This idea is for clients beyond the 12-month window or those without the wherewithal to repay benefits. </p>
            <p>Upon reaching normal retirement age, your client can suspend benefits until age 70 and earn delayed retirement credits. This approach may restore much of your client’s PIA as illustrated by the following example: </p>
            <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3><p>Assume your client Joe’s PIA at normal retirement age is $2,000. Joe claimed and began collecting a reduced benefit of $1,500 at his age 62.</p><p>If Joe suspends benefits from age 66 until age 70, he will earn delayed retirement credits of 32% (8% per year). His retirement benefit at age 70 will be $1,980 (a 32% increase to the $1,500).</p></div>
