</p>
  <p>Clients fearful of running out of money during their retirement years may be intrigued by the lifetime payments of an annuity. An annuity is simply a contract to provide a series of periodic payments to an individual (the annuitant) for a period of time.</p>
  <p>There is no free lunch however. Annuities have potential downsides including the following:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Annuities may not provide an appropriate pool of emergency capital or sufficiently fund a client’s legacy goals for loved ones.</li>
    <li>Annuity cancellation or termination fees may be significant, especially in the early years of the annuity contract.</li>
    <li>Recurring annuity fees may be higher than IRA or qualified plan fees.</li>
    <li>Unlike qualified plan accounts, there is no federal guarantee in case of insurance company insolvency. Annuities are generally guaranteed within limits by associations sponsored by the individual states.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For our purposes in this discussion, we assume the annuity is an <a href="#" title="An &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immediate annuity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is characterized by the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The annuitant (your client) pays the annuity provider an amount of money referred to as the premium. This represents your client’s cost of the annuity. The premium amount is calculated by the provider based upon actuarial life expectancy, market rates of return, and other factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The annuity provider (a financial services company) pays the annuitant over a period of time (frequently some variation of the annuitant’s lifetime).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For annuities paid over the annuitant’s lifetime, if the annuitant lives until age 100, the annuitant wins big. If the annuitant dies one month after purchasing the annuity, the annuity provider wins big. Additional detail is provided in the discussion that follows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">immediate annuity</a>, meaning that annuity payments begin immediately after the purchase price is paid.</p>
  <p>Annuity payments can be an unchanging fixed amount (<a href="#" title="A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;fixed annuity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; pays a fixed, guaranteed amount for the duration of the annuity contract. The annuitant generally does not have control over the investment choices. " class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">fixed annuity</a>) or an amount that varies based upon investment performance (<a href="#" title="A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;variable annuity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; pays a variable amount for the duration of the contract based upon the investment performance of the annuity’s investment portfolio. The annuitant generally may select the investments from a list approved by the annuity provider. The annuity provider may not guarantee a specific monthly payout amount." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">variable annuity</a>).</p>

              <p>This choice may be appropriate for clients with the following needs:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>Maximum income for themselves during their remaining lifetime</li>
                <li>No need to provide for loved ones at death</li>
                <li>No need for a pool of emergency capital</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A straight life annuity pays an income stream to your client for the remainder of his or her life and provides the<em><strong> highest monthly payout</strong></em> per dollar invested in the annuity contract. This type of annuity may also be referred to as a “pure annuity.”</p>
              <p>The annuity payments stop at death and your client’s heirs receive nothing from the annuity. There is no residual value from a straight life annuity at the death of the annuitant. Below is an example.</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3><p>A 60-year-old male purchasing a $100,000 immediate fixed annuity payable over his lifetime would receive $490 per month based upon 2015 fixed annuity rates.

              <p>Clients with a desire to receive an annuity payout for a guaranteed number of years may find this choice interesting. If your client dies prematurely, the remaining payments will be remitted to the beneficiary.</p>

                  <li>The cost of the 20-year period certain feature is the reduction of the monthly benefit by $30 versus the straight life annuity. </li>

              <p>This option may appeal to clients concerned about dying before they have at least been paid their investment into the annuity contract. </p>
			  <p>A life annuity with refund guarantees the return of the original investment used to purchase the annuity. If the annuitant dies before the original investment is paid out, his or her beneficiaries receive the remaining amount in a lump sum.</p>
              <p>The monthly payout from a life annuity with refund feature results in a lower monthly payout than the straight life annuity. Below is an example.</p>

              <p>A married annuitant might choose this option if she wished to provide an income stream to her husband upon her death. In effect, a joint and survivor annuity is paid out over two lifetimes: the annuitant’s and the surviving beneficiary’s lifetime.</p>
              <p>The monthly payout from this annuity may be significantly less than the monthly payout from a straight life annuity. The annuity payments stop completely at the second death and there is no residual value for distribution to other beneficiaries. Below is an example.</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3><p>A 60-year-old male purchasing a $100,000 immediate fixed annuity payable over his lifetime with a 100% survivorship feature for his 60-year-old wife would receive $431* per month for the rest of his life. </p>
              	<ul>
                	<li>In the event of his death, his surviving wife would begin receiving monthly payments of $431 per month until her death.</li>
                    <li>Annuity payments cease completely at the wife’s death and the annuity terminates with no residual value.</li>
                    <li>The cost of the joint and survivor 100% feature is the reduction of the monthly benefit by $59 versus the straight life annuity. </li>
                </ul>
              	<p>The survivorship feature can be structured at levels other than 100%. For example, a joint and survivor 50% annuity would result in the surviving spouse receiving a monthly benefit equal to 50% of the amount paid to the decedent spouse.</p>
