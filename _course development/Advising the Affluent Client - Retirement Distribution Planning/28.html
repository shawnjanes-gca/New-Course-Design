  <p>Throw a large rock into a small pond and the ripples spread out then cross back over each other. Distribution planning is very much like that, decisions in one area impact choices in other areas. Our goal in this course is to raise your awareness of how distribution decisions in one area, such as Social Security benefits, impact a host of other decisions as well. </p>
  <p>Use your awareness to guide clients safely past common mistakes in distribution decisions. Click <a href="greene/addaffretdistplan/10_Common_rd_mistakes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for a PDF of common mistakes along with recommendations for avoiding them.</p>
  <p>We hope this course has deepened your skills in recognizing and responding to client distribution planning needs. While we have provided you with an in-depth overview of different retirement plans and the rules associated with them, it is up to you to begin using this knowledge to assist your clients. </p>
