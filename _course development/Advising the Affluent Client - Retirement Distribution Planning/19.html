               <p>Working  in retirement, at least part-time, has obvious and not so obvious benefits. The  obvious benefits are financial: generating cash flow to delay collection of  Social Security benefits or supplementing an inadequate retirement plan. The  more subtle benefits may include quality of life issues beyond dollars and  cents, such as mental and physical health. As a financial bonus, a healthier  retiree would be expected to spend less on health care.</p>

Your client&rsquo;s insurance professional, attorney, CPA,  and/or CFP® professional should be involved in this dialog.</em></strong></p>
              <p>The cash value of a life insurance policy can supplement  retirement income in at least three ways: 1) <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A life insurance policy with a cash value can generally be  exchanged for an annuity in a transaction referred to as a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tax-free  exchange&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; The cash value of a life insurance policy is generally that  amount that would be received by the policy owner if the owner cancelled  (surrendered) the policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax-free exchanges are permitted under a special IRS  provision contained in Internal Revenue Code Section 1035. Such an exchange may  be referred to as a &quot;Section 1035 Exchange.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An exchange should be considered ONLY if life  insurance protection is no longer needed and after consultation with your  internal compliance team and &lt;em&gt;your  client's insurance professional, attorney, CPA, and/or CFP&lt;sup style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;&reg;&lt;/sup&gt;  professional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extreme care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; must be taken to avoid the “surrender squeeze.” The surrender squeeze results when so much of the cash value is withdrawn that the policy collapses and the life insurance coverage is lost." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">partial withdrawal  of the cash value</a>; and 3) <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;How many people would sign up for loans in which no interest or principal had to be repaid during their lifetime?

&lt;p&gt;Loans from most* life insurance policies are not subject to income tax. Interest must be paid or accrued on life insurance policy loans. Interest charges may generally be paid from policy dividends at the discretion of the policy owner. The loan proceeds may be used in a number of ways, including investment into a portfolio, deposit into a short-term savings account, or purchase of an annuity.&lt;/p&gt;
