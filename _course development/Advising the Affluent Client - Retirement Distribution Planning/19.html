<p>&ldquo;Too few people consider the psychological adjustments that accompany this life stage [retirement], which can include coping with the loss of your career identity, replacing support networks you had through work, spending more time than ever before with your spouse and finding new and engaging ways to stay active.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>&ldquo;Research by psychologists and others has found that working or volunteering during retirement can help stave off depression, as well as dementia and hypertension.&rdquo;*</p>

<p>Working in retirement, at least part-time, has obvious and not so obvious benefits. The obvious benefits are financial: generating cash flow to delay collection of Social Security benefits or supplementing an inadequate retirement plan. The more subtle benefits may include quality of life issues beyond dollars and cents, such as mental and physical health. As a financial bonus, a healthier retiree would be expected to spend less on health care.</p>

<h4>Tax-Free Exchange</h4>
<p>A life insurance policy with a cash value can generally be exchanged for an annuity in a transaction referred to as a &ldquo;<strong><em>tax-free exchange</em></strong>.&rdquo; The cash value of a life insurance policy is generally that amount that would be received by the policy owner if the owner cancelled (surrendered) the policy.</p>
<p>Tax-free exchanges are permitted under a special IRS provision contained in Internal Revenue Code Section 1035. Such an exchange may be referred to as a &ldquo;Section 1035 Exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<strong>An exchange should be considered ONLY if life insurance protection is no longer needed and after consultation with your internal compliance team and <em>your client&rsquo;s insurance professional, attorney, CPA, and/or CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professional.</em></strong>

<h4>Partial Withdrawal of the Cash Value</h4>
<p>The cash value may generally be withdrawn income tax-free up to the amount of the investment in the policy. Investment in the policy is generally defined as premiums paid less the sum of dividends and previous partial withdrawals received.</p>
<strong><em>Extreme care</em></strong>must be taken to avoid the &ldquo;surrender squeeze.&rdquo; The surrender squeeze results when so much of the cash value is withdrawn that the policy collapses and the life insurance coverage is lost.

<h4>Borrowing Against the Cash Value</h4>
<p>How many people would sign up for loans in which no interest or principal had to be repaid during their lifetime? This alluring strategy may be available in your client&rsquo;s life insurance policy contract. Noteworthy - the loan amount and any unpaid interest are deducted from the death benefit at the insured&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Loans from most* life insurance policies are not subject to income tax. Interest must be paid or accrued on life insurance policy loans. Interest charges may generally be paid from policy dividends at the discretion of the policy owner. The loan proceeds may be used in a number of ways, including investment into a portfolio, deposit into a short-term savings account, or purchase of an annuity.</p>
