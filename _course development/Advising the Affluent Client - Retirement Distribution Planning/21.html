  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Understanding Social Security Spousal Benefits </span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The spouse of a worker may collect a spousal benefit on the worker’s <a href="#" title="A worker’s record is their individual record of earnings from covered employment during their entire lifetime. Covered employment is any employment in which Social Security taxes are withheld." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">record </a>even if the worker’s spouse has never worked outside of the home. A spousal benefit can only be collected if the worker has claimed a benefit. The spousal benefit can be as high as 50% of the worker’s PIA if both spouses are of normal retirement age.  However, if spousal benefits are claimed before normal retirement age, the 50% benefit is reduced dramatically.  Below is an example.</p>
  
  <div><em class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3><p>John and Mary are married and age 66 (their full retirement age). John has never worked outside of the home. Mary filed for retirement benefits immediately upon reaching age 66.  Her PIA is $2,600. John may claim and receive a monthly spousal benefit of $1,300 (50% of $2,600) based upon Mary’s record. </p>
</em></div>
  
  <p>The spouse must be at least age 62 or caring for an <a href="#" title="The worker’s child under the age of 16 or any age if disabled before the age of 22 is an eligible child. " class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">eligible child</a> to collect a spousal benefit. Below is an example.</p>
  
  <div><em class="explanation-widget-box">
  	<h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Samuel and Kitty are married. Kitty is age 66 (her normal retirement age) and collecting retirement benefits.</p>
    <p>Samuel can collect spousal benefits on Kitty’s record if he is at least age 62. It would be better for him to wait until his normal retirement age to file for spousal benefits because his benefit would be be significantly larger.</p>
    <p>Assume Samuel is only age 40. He is eligible for a spousal benefit on Kitty’s record ONLY if he is caring for an eligible child of Kitty’s. </p>
</em></div>

  <p>How are spousal benefits calculated if the worker’s spouse worked outside of the home and has an individual record? Social Security pays a benefit to the spouse based upon his or her individual record first and then, to the extent a spousal benefit is greater, pays an additional amount as a spousal benefit. Below is an example.</p>
  
   <div><em class="explanation-widget-box">
  	<h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Sherlock and Irene are married and age 66 (their full retirement age). They each filed for Social Security retirement benefits immediately upon reaching age 66. Sherlock is the primary wage earner with a PIA of $2,600 on his record. Irene’s PIA is $1,000 based upon her record.</p>
    <p>Irene will receive $1,300 per month calculated as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$1,000 on her record</li>
	  <li>300 as a spousal benefit on Sherlock’s record </li>
    </ul>

            <p><em><strong>The largest retirement spousal benefit is generally 50% of the worker’s benefit and is paid only when the worker has claimed a retirement benefit and both the worker and the spouse of the worker have reached full retirement age.</strong></em></p>
