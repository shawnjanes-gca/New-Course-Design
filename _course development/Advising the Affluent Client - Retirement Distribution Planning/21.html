<p>A <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>traditional married couple</strong></a> may find as much as $60,000 or more in &ldquo;free money&rdquo; merely by separating the claiming date from the collection date. This feat is accomplished through two creative claiming strategies: 1) File and Suspend; and 2) Filing a Restricted Claim. In the discussion that follows, we illustrate complex concepts through a series of straightforward and detailed examples. You may be reminded of specific clients or prospects as you consider these examples.</p>
<p>Creative claiming strategies are about people - your clients - and not about rules. We have to know the rules to serve our clients; however, our analysis of these strategies is designed for three types of traditional married couple. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click each to learn more.</strong></p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The File and Suspend election is ideal for marriages in which only one spouse works outside of the home, the spouses are about the same age, and the wage-earning spouse wishes to work until age 70.</p>
<p>File and Suspend is the solution and here is how it works: a) the worker <strong>files</strong> for (claims) benefits, and then b) immediately <strong>suspends</strong> collection of those benefits. There are at least two potentially lucrative reasons to elect File and Suspend:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Qualifies the worker&rsquo;s spouse to receive spousal benefits on the worker&rsquo;s record, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earns delayed retirement credits on the worker&rsquo;s record.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you consider this concept, remember that spousal benefits generally can only be paid if the worker has <em>claimed</em> benefits. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> to see how this powerful election could generate as much as $60,000 in &ldquo;free&rdquo; benefits. </strong></p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Filing a Restricted Claim is designed for two-income marriages in which one spouse has a significantly higher PIA than the other spouse, the primary wage-earner wishes to collect benefits at normal retirement age, and there is a desire for the lesser earning spouse to collect spousal benefits.<strong style="color: #ff0000;"> Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> to see an example that demonstrates the power of filing a Restricted Claim.</strong></p>
<p>The dramatic net result is produced because Sarah collects only spousal benefits restricted to Charles&rsquo; record. She is NOT required to collect any benefits from her own individual record. As a result, Sarah receives a substantial income stream for four full years from Charles&rsquo; record while earning delayed retirement credits on her own record.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Here is an intriguing strategy for financially successful couples in which each spouse has high earnings. For such couples, the combination of File and Suspend with filing a Restricted Claim can leverage Social Security retirement benefits to unprecedented heights.</p>
<p>The combination approach works best for married clients of approximately the same age with high individual PIAs. Clients fitting this profile may enjoy Social Security retirement benefits as follows:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>
<p>Husband earns delayed credits on his individual record,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wife earns delayed credits on her individual record, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wife* collects free spousal benefits on husband&rsquo;s record beginning at her NRA.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the seismic takeaway - <strong><em>both spouses are earning delayed retirement credits AND, simultaneously, one spouse is receiving current spousal benefits!</em></strong></p>
<p>The combination approach is best illustrated by <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>example</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">*<em>This assumes the husband&rsquo;s PIA is greater. If the wife&rsquo;s PIA is greater, then the roles are reversed.</em></span></p>

<h4>Traditional Married Couple</h4>
<p>Purely for purposes of the Social Security discussion in this course, we define a <strong><em>traditional married couple </em></strong>as two heterosexual spouses of approximately the same age in a long-term, legally-wedded union. This distinction is made so that we may subsequently share strategies for other couples, such as those in a second family or same gender marriage.</p>

<h4>Example - Free $60,000</h4>
<p>Your clients Fred and Farrah Franklin, both aged 66, look to you for financial advice.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Neither Fred nor Farrah have claimed or collected Social Security retirement benefits previously. Farrah has been the sole breadwinner while Fred has not worked outside of the home. Age 66 is their normal retirement age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farrah&rsquo;s monthly retirement check, calculated on her own record, would be $2,500 if she filed and began collecting benefits at age 66. However, the allure of a permanent increase of 32% to her monthly retirement check has motivated Farrah to delay retirement until age 70.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The couple could use additional cash flow for the next four years, but there is a problem. Fred has no record upon which he may claim his own Social Security retirement benefits and, under the general spousal benefit rules, <strong><em>he is not eligible for a spousal benefit on Farrah&rsquo;s record until she files for her own benefits.</em></strong></p>
<p>How do they get the cash flow they need for the next four years?</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Farrah can file for retirement benefits on her own record and immediately suspend the collection of her benefits. Because Farrah has now filed, Fred may now file a claim for spousal benefits on his wife&rsquo;s record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will immediately begin receiving spousal Social Security retirement benefit checks of $1,250 monthly, plus cost-of-living adjustments. Meanwhile, Farrah earns an annual 8% delayed retirement credit to her own benefit until her age 70.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The net result is a beautiful thing.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Fred collects $60,000 in free money (48 months @ $1,250 per month) from spousal benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that were not enough, Farrah&rsquo;s retirement benefit jumps from $30,000 annually at age 66 to nearly $40,000 at age 70! This represents a 32% raise courtesy of her delayed retirement credit.</p>
</li>

<h4>Example - Filing a Restricted Claim</h4>
<p>Mrs. Sarah and Mr. Charles Magnussen are your clients. They are each 66 years of age (their normal retirement age). Both spouses were wage-earners yet Charles was the primary breadwinner.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Charles filed for retirement benefits on his record immediately upon reaching age 66. He will receive monthly checks of 100% of his PIA of $2,500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s PIA on her own record at age 66 is $1,275.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah has a filing choice - she can receive $1,275 monthly by filing a claim for retirement benefits on her record <strong><em>or</em></strong> receive a 50% spousal benefit ($1,250) monthly by filing a restricted claim for spousal benefits on Charles&rsquo; record.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Counterintuitively, Sarah should file a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits immediately and here is why:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>She will earn delayed retirement credits on her own benefit because she is not taking benefits from her own record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the delayed retirement credits, her retirement benefit on her own record will grow to almost $1,700 per month (132% of $1,275) by her age 70.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At age 70, Sarah should file for retirement benefits on her own record.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The net result is dramatic.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Sarah gained over $400 per month for life ($4,900 annually) at age 70 as a result of the delayed credits. If she lives until age 85, she will have gained over $73,000!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is her cost? Her only cost is the $25 per month she gave up from age 66 until age 70. That&rsquo;s a total cost of only $1,200 (48 months at $25/month).</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Perry and Marilyn Gregson are your clients. They are age 66 (their normal retirement age). Neither Perry nor Marilyn have claimed or collected Social Security retirement benefits previously. Perry&rsquo;s PIA is $2,600 and Marilyn&rsquo;s PIA equals $2,000. Perry plans to work until age 70 to earn delayed retirement credits but Marilyn wishes to stop working now. They need income to replace a portion of Marilyn&rsquo;s income from employment.</p>
<p>Here is what happens next in the combination strategy.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Perry claims and suspends the benefit on his record in the current year (his age 66, his NRA). He earns delayed retirement credits because his benefits are suspended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marilyn files a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits on Perry&rsquo;s record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marilyn earns delayed retirement credits on her record because she has not filed for benefits on her record.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume that Perry and Marilyn wait until age 70 to claim and collect benefits on their individual record.&nbsp; The financial results follow.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Marilyn receives spousal benefits on Perry&rsquo;s record of over $62,000 (50% of Perry&rsquo;s PIA for the four years from age 66 through age 70).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perry&rsquo;s annual retirement benefit grows by about $10,000 <strong><em>for life</em></strong> as a result of his delayed retirement credits (32% of his age 66 benefit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marilyn&rsquo;s annual retirement benefit grows by about $8,000 <strong><em>for life</em></strong> as a result of her delayed retirement credits (32% of her age 66 benefit).</p>
