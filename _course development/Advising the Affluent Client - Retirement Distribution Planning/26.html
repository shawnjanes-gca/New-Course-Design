<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to introduce your client to tax management ideas to boost after-tax income. Be sure to involve your internal income tax resources or your client’s CPA in this process. The number and variety of strategies to manage income tax are legion. However, you may find that at least one of the ideas in this discussion will ignite client interest.</p>
  <p>With all due respect to Mr. Einstein, income tax in retirement can not only be understood, it may be managed as well. The ideal retirement distribution plan is, to some degree, a balancing act. We must balance distributions from Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, Qualified Plans, and Social Security benefits not only against each other, but also against income taxes.</p>
  <p>The discussion below introduces a select few tax management opportunities. <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each of the following to learn more:</span></p>

              <p>State income taxes can siphon off as much as 9% of your client’s taxable income. Other states have no state income taxes at all. Even among those states that levy an income tax, special tax breaks for retirees (such as exclusion of Social Security benefits from taxable income) may be available. </p>
              <p>As part of your distribution dialog with retiring clients, an analysis of the long-term savings possible from moving to another state may be impactful. Be aware some states have other taxes (such as taxes on investment assets) that could offset income tax savings. </p>

              <p>Even if conversion to a Roth IRA is appropriate, the conversion should be timed to minimize income tax costs. The taxable income generated by conversion of a pretax qualified plan account balance or Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may cause two unwanted income tax consequences: (1) a higher income tax rate bracket and (2) increased taxation of Social Security benefits. As much as 85% of a client’s Social Security benefits may be taxable based upon a client’s <a href="#" title="Combined income is adjusted gross income from the income tax return plus tax-exempt interest plus ½ of Social Security benefits received.

              <p>The judicious use of nontaxable income sources could keep  your client from paying unnecessary income tax on Social Security benefits. As  much as 85% of Social Security benefits may be included in taxable income based  upon whether your client takes taxable or nontaxable distributions. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If your client is nearing the 50% or 85%  threshold for inclusion of Social Security benefits into taxable income, consider taking any additional income needed from Roth IRAs or Designated Roth  Accounts instead of taking taxable distributions.</li>
                  <li>Coordinate income tax rate planning with  distribution selection. In a high-income year, tap the Roth IRA or Designated  Roth Account. In a low-income year, tap the Traditional IRA or non-Roth Qualified  Plan account.  </li>
                  <li>Do not pay for medical expenses with taxable  distributions if HSA funds are available.</li>
                  <li>Remember that municipal bond income may trigger additional income tax on Social Security benefits as a result of the combined  income formula.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The common theme here is  management of future income tax events rather than trying to deal with the  consequences after distributions have been taken! Your client and his or her  CPA may appreciate you for emphasizing this planning ethic.</p>
