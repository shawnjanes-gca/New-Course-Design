  <p>Why do shrewd advisors need to understand the implications of Social Security for single, divorced, and widowed clients?</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>In a seismic shift from two generations ago, 5 of every 10 adults are choosing to remain single. </li>
    <li>The CDC recently reported that for every two marriages there is one divorce. </li>
    <li>About 14 million people in the U.S. are widowed. </li>
  </ul>

              <p>The popular press gives scant attention to claiming strategies for single workers. While the opportunities for creativity are limited, you should be aware of at least one. Single clients reaching age 66 by April 30, 2016, are eligible for the File and Suspend <a href="#" title="The retroactive lump sum option allows an eligible individual to file for benefits, suspend those benefits, and then collect a lump sum of all suspended benefits at a future date." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">retroactive lump sum option</a>.</p>
              <p>Regrettably, single clients did not escape the ax of the BBA of 2015. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The File and Suspend Strategy and retroactive lump sum option were virtually eliminated by the BBA of 2015 for those workers younger than age 66 on April 30, 2016.</li>
                <li>File and Suspend is available for new filings only if your client has reached full retirement age AND files and suspends by April 30, 2016.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Those clients previously filing and suspending are grandfathered in under the previous law and will not lose File and Suspend benefits. In addition, an individual reaching age 66 on or before April 30, 2016, is also grandfathered into the <strong>retroactive lump sum option</strong>.  Below is an example of how this approach could generate a lump sum payment of well over $100,000. Be aware that this strategy can also be used by married clients, subject to the BBA of 2015.</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box">
              	<h3>Example – File and  Suspend "insurance policy" for single clients</h3>
                 <p> Your client Sherlock is single. Sherlock reached age 66  before April 30, 2016. His normal retirement age is 67. His PIA at age 67 is  $2,600. He elects to File and Suspend payments at his age 67.</p>
                <p> Here are the results.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>At his age 70, he is entitled to claim a lump sum benefit of all suspended payments from age 67 through age 70.</li>
                  <li>He may request and receive a retroactive lump sum payment at any time after age 67. He will receive a check of well over $93,000* if he chooses to do so at his age 70.</li>
                  <li>Sherlock will NOT receive delayed retirement credits for the months included in the retroactive lump sum payment. </li>
                </ul>

  <li>Both of the spouses must be at least age 62, and</li>
</ol>
<p>Ineligible for a higher  benefit based upon their individual record.</p>">Eligible divorced clients</span></a> may have rights to Social Security benefits on their former spouse’s record using the restricted claim strategy previously discussed.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>In the wake of the BBA of 2015, the Restricted Claim strategy remains a powerful option for clients reaching age 62 by December 31, 2015. </strong>Such individuals may file a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits when they reach full retirement age. </li>
                <li>Clients who are younger than age 62 on December 31, 2015, are no longer eligible for the Restricted Claim strategy.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Interestingly enough, your divorced client is eligible for benefits even if their former spouse has not claimed benefits.</p>
              <p>Your divorced client may receive current monthly benefits on his or her former spouse’s record AND simultaneously earn delayed retirement credits on his or her individual record. While that may sound too good to be true, it simply requires the filing of a Restricted Claim at your client’s normal retirement age. See the power of this approach by viewing the example below.</p>
			  <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example – Filing a Restricted Claim – Divorced Client</h3>
              <p>Tom and Katie are divorced. Katie remains unmarried and she meets all five of the criteria listed above.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Katie and Tom are both age 62.</li>
                <li>Katie’s PIA at her normal retirement age (66) is $1,400.</li>
                <li>Tom’s PIA at his normal retirement age (66) is $2,600.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Katie has a choice - she can file for retirement benefits on her own record and accept a permanent reduction in her benefits or she can wait until her normal retirement age and file a Restricted Claim for spousal benefits on Tom’s record.</p>
              <p>The advantages to Katie’s filing a Restricted Claim at her age 66 follow:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>She will earn delayed retirement credits on her record of up to 32% (8% per year until age 70).</li>
                <li>She will receive a $1,300 monthly spousal benefit on Tom’s record from her age 66 until her age 70. Noteworthy - this is only $100/month less than the benefit she could collect if claiming on her own record during this same 4-year period.</li>
                <li>She should file for benefits on her record at her age 70, generating a monthly income for life of about $1,850.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>What just happened as a result of Katie’s filing a Restricted Claim?</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>She receives a $5,400 annual raise for life by waiting until age 70 to claim her own benefits. </li>
                 <li>Katie’s cost in securing this lifetime annual raise is a mere $4,800; the $100 per month she gave up from her age 66 to age 70.</li>
                 <li>She receives over $62,000 in “free” spousal benefits on Tom’s record ($1,300 per month for the 4 years from age 66 through age 70).</li>

              <p>Picture this scene from a movie if you will. A recently widowed client is in her advisor’s office. She is deeply worried about the loss of her husband’s Social Security income, even as she struggles to deal with her grief. </p>
              <p>How would she react to a doubling of her monthly Social Security payment?</p>
              <p>A spouse with no individual earnings record is entitled to collect a spousal retirement benefit of as much as 50% of the worker spouse’s PIA while the worker is alive. But when the worker dies, the surviving spouse may be entitled to a survivors benefit equal to 100% of the workers benefit at death. See the example below for an illustration.</p>
			  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
              	<h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Mr. Jonathan and Mrs. Mary Small are your clients. They are both age 74 and have been married for 40 years. Jonathan is collecting a retirement benefit of $2,800 per month on his record and Mary is collecting a spousal retirement benefit on his record of $1,400 per month.</p>
                <p>Regrettably, Jonathan was killed yesterday in a Class V whitewater rafting mishap. Mary is now entitled to a survivorship benefit of $2,800 per month (plus cost-of-living adjustments) for the rest of her life.</p>
                <p>Here is what just happened. Mary switched her 50% spousal retirement benefit to a survivor’s 100% benefit! She gains almost $185,000* in additional benefits if she lives until age 85.</p>

				  <div class="footertext"></div>
				  <!-- footertext -->
				  <p>*Calculated as $1,400 per month extra for 10 years.</p>
			  </footer>
			  </div>
              <p>This story illustrates a little understood benefit of delaying the collection of benefits until age 70. Because your widow or widower collects 100% of the benefits you were collecting at death, their survivorship benefits increase when you delay until age 70!</p>
              <p>The most dramatic impact is felt when the surviving spouse has no individual record. However, as long as the surviving spouse’s record has a significantly lower  PIA than that of the deceased spouse, there is potential for a weighty increase in payout. Widows and widowers enjoy a slight age advantage also - survivorship benefits are generally available as early as age 60 (50 if disabled). </p>
