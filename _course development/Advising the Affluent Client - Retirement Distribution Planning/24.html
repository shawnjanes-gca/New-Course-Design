<p>Benefits are reduced for workers choosing to <strong><em>retire before normal retirement age</em></strong> (NRA) if they earn excess income. The reduction is based upon two earnings tests: <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>earnings before NRA</strong></a> and <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>earnings during the year of NRA</strong></a>. There is no reduction of benefits for income earned in the years after normal retirement age.</p>
<p>Noteworthy - any benefits reduced by the earnings test may not be completely lost, they may be recoverable in future years. The recovery calculation can become somewhat complex but for those wishing to know more, <strong style="color: #ff0000;">click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer5','','show')" href="#_s">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Randy Retiree (age 64) began taking Social Security retirement benefits at age 62. His NRA is age 65. Randy&rsquo;s retirement benefit, calculated without regard to the earnings test, would have been $18,000 per year. In the current year, Randy earned $10,000 MORE than the annual limit referenced above. Therefore, Randy&rsquo;s retirement benefit will be reduced by $5,000 - he will receive only $13,000 in the current year.</p>

<h4>Example of Recoverable Benefits</h4>
<p>Your client Brian began collecting retirement benefits on his record at age 62. He was born in 1954 and because he claimed and collected at age 62, he incurred a permanent reduction of his PIA of 25%.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His NRA is age 66. During the 5-year period from age 62 through age 66, his retirement benefits were <strong>reduced</strong> as a result of the earnings tests by the <strong>equivalent of 12 months of benefit payments</strong>. <strong> </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Brian reaches his NRA of 66, his monthly retirement benefit will be recalculated as if he first claimed benefits at age 63 instead of age 62.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why age 63? He lost the equivalent of 12 months of benefit payments as a result of the earnings tests. That &ldquo;lost&rdquo; 12 months is added back to his claiming age (62) so that his new claiming age becomes age 63.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How does this recalculated claiming age help Brian? The recalculated claiming age of 63 means his early retirement decrease to PIA becomes only 20% instead of 25%.</p>
Therefore, his benefit payment will increase at age 66 by 5% of his PIA. If he lives long enough, he will recover all of the reduced benefits.
