<h2>Capitalizing on Opportunities: <em>Selecting the Appropriate Education Savings Vehicle</em></h2>

<p>As you can see, the range of education savings vehicles available to affluent clients is numerous, each with its own merits and weaknesses. The key issue is selecting the right vehicle, given a particular client's unique circumstances. The importance of helping clients be truly thoughtful in this analysis is captured in this true story.</p>

<p>James Kelly contacted Frank Johnson, his advisor, 15 years ago and inquired about setting up an account for his son, who had just turned three. Frank spent a few minutes sharing war stories about the joys of raising a young son and then proceeded to talk business.</p>
<p>James said he wanted to start setting aside some money for his son's education and wanted to know the best way to do it. Frank quickly replied, "Let's just set up an UGMA, which will put the money in your son's name but enable you to maintain control over how the money is managed." And so, it was. The account was set up and James funded the UGMA with 3000 shares in a start-up venture run by two of James' friends.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a few months ago when James called Frank and was obviously troubled, and rightfully so. The account he had set up years ago for his son had performed quite well. In fact, the account, valued at just over $15,000 at the time it was set up was now worth over $3.2 million, and his son would be turning 18 in just a few weeks, giving him full and unfettered access to this wealth.</p>
