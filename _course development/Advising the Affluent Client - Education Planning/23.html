<p>The final step is to educate clients on potential tax credits that may be available to them. There are two tax credits and three deductions that individuals can potentially use to ease the burden of rising education expenses:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_2" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>This credit is 100% of qualified tuition, fees, and course materials paid by the taxpayer for the taxpayer's or dependent's qualified education expenses, up to $2,000 plus 25% of the next $2,000 of expenses. Thus, the maximum AOTC is $2,500. This credit is applied on a per-student basis, enabling families to claim the credit for each family member attending a qualified post-secondary school at least half time in any one year.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong>:<br /> This credit is only applicable to the child&rsquo;s first four years of post-secondary education. Furthermore, the AOTC, the Lifetime Learning Credit, or Tuition and Fees Deduction cannot be claimed for the same student in the same year. For the tax year 2015, this credit phases out for single filers with modified AGI of $80,000-$90,000 and joint filers with modified AGI of $160,000-$180,000. Other limitations may apply and the client should consult his or her tax advisor regarding use of this credit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_3" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Similar in structure to the AOTC, the Lifetime Learning Credit enables families to claim a tax credit for qualifying education expenses or for expenses associated with part-time classes at a qualifying educational institution taken to improve or upgrade job skills. Specifically, families can claim a credit for 20% of the first $10,000 of qualifying tuition and fees. (Note: This credit maximum is $2,000 per family, not per taxpayer/dependent.)</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions:<br /> </strong>The AOTC, the Lifetime Learning Credit, or Tuition and Fees Deduction cannot be claimed for the same student in the same year. This credit phases out for taxpayers earning beyond certain levels of income (indexed for inflation).&nbsp; For the tax year 2015, the credit phases out for single filers with modified AGI of $55,000-$65,000 and for joint filers with modified AGI of $110,000-$130,000. Other limitations may apply and the client should consult his or her tax advisor regarding use of this credit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_4" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Interest paid on private or government-backed loans for qualifying post-secondary education and training expenses (including tuition, fees, books, equipment, room and board) is an "above the line" deduction in calculating adjusted gross income (whether or not the taxpayer itemizes deductions). The maximum allowable deduction in any one year is $2,500.</p>
<p>For the tax year 2015, this deduction phases out for single filers with modified AGI of $60,000-$75,000 and for joint filers with modified AGI of $125,000-$155,000 (phase out limits are indexed for inflation). Other limitations may apply. The client should consult his or her tax advisor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_5" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The Tuition and Fees Deduction EXPIRED on December 31, 2014. However, this deduction also expired in 2013 and was reinstated by Congress for 2014. It is possible Congress may once again act to reinstate this deduction in 2015.</p>
<p>Tuition and certain related expenses for a qualified student paid to an eligible post-secondary educational institution can also be an "above the line" deduction in calculating adjusted gross income. The maximum deduction is $4,000 in 2014 if the taxpayer's Modified AGI is less than $65,000 (Single/Head of Household/Qualifying Widow(er)) or $130,000 (Married Filing Jointly).</p>
<p>Between an MAGI of $65,000-$80,000 (S/HOH/QW) or $130,000-$160,000 (MFJ), the deduction is $2,000.</p>
<p>The taxpayer is not eligible for the deduction if MAGI exceeds $80,000 (S/HOH/QW) or $160,000 (MFJ).</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong>:<br /> If a taxpayer utilizes an educational tax credit, this deduction is not available for the same student in the same tax year or vice versa. The taxpayer must reduce the qualified education expenses by the amount of any tax-free educational assistance and refunds received. Other limitations may apply and the client should consult his or her tax advisor regarding use of this deduction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_6" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>An employee taxpayer may be able to deduct work-related education expenses as a miscellaneous itemized deduction to the extent that certain miscellaneous deductions exceed 2% of the taxpayer's AGI. A self-employed individual would deduct qualifying education expenses from self-employment income. This deduction would not typically prevent the taxpayer from utilizing the above listed credits and deductions.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong>: <br /> To deduct the work-related education expenses, two tests must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The taxpayer's employer must require the education to maintain the taxpayer's salary, position, or job status. The required education must serve a bona fide business purpose for the taxpayer's employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education maintains or improves skills needed in the taxpayer's work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
Note that the education expenses will not be deductible if the education is needed to meet the minimum educational requirements of the taxpayer's trade or business or, if the education qualifies the taxpayer for a new trade or business. Other limitations may apply and the client should consult his or her tax advisor regarding use of this deduction.</div>
