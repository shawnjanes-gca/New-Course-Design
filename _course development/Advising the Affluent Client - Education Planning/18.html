            <p>Less well known than the income tax benefits of 529 Plans are the Estate and Gift tax benefits. Contributions to 529 Plans are considered a completed gift, meaning the assets are no longer considered part of the contributor's estate. This provision enables higher net worth individuals to use 529 Plans as part of an overall strategy to reduce the size of their estate and, thus, their potential estate tax liability, while still maintaining a high degree of control over the assets (choosing investment options, designating beneficiary, and making withdrawals).</p>

            <p>Individuals making contributions to a 529 Plan can elect to receive accelerated gift tax treatment, enabling them to make the equivalent of 5 years of gift tax-free transfers in one year. In 2016 (as indexed), rather than being limited to $14,000 per beneficiary per year ($28,000 if married and making split gifts) without triggering gift taxes, individuals can make up to 5 years of contributions in a lump sum (up to $70,000 per beneficiary for single contributors and $140,000 for married contributors) without triggering gift taxes.</p>
            <p>One caveat to making this election is if total contributions to each beneficiary exceeds five times the annual gift tax exclusion, the excess amount is treated as a taxable gift in the year of contribution. </p>
