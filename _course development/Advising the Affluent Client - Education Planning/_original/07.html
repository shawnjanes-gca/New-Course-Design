<p>The most obvious and most often chosen option for college savings is the traditional private investment account. Although traditional investment accounts do offer some advantages relative to other education investment vehicles, they are typically the most tax-inefficient option. Most often, individuals simply choose traditional investment accounts to fund their children's education expenses because they have never been made aware of the alternatives.</p>
<h4><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Private Investment Accounts</strong></h4>
<p>Let's examine some of the advantages and disadvantages of using private investment accounts to fund education expenses.</p>

<p>Another advantage of traditional investment accounts as education savings vehicles is the fact that the account owner maintains absolute control over the use of the assets. Most other education savings vehicles have stipulations regarding how the assets in the account may be used and/or transfer control of the assets to the beneficiary at a specified time.</p>

<p>Private investment accounts are subject to current federal and state income taxes. Other education savings alternatives offer the donor tax-deferred growth in the account and tax-free withdrawals for qualified expenses. Generally, the significant tax advantages offered by alternative education savings vehicles outweigh the flexibility and control offered by private investment accounts, making the vehicles covered in the following pages more attractive.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to somewhat mitigate this disadvantage through investment in qualified U.S. Savings Bonds, where interest is tax-exempt if proceeds are used for qualified tuition and/or fees, provided the bond is purchased by an individual over age 24. However, this option provides only limited growth potential and is only available for individuals whose personal income does not exceed certain limits and is coordinated with other education benefits.</p>
