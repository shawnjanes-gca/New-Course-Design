    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Beginning around 1990, states started developing a new type of plan designed to encourage savings for college expenses. Subsequently, in 1996, legislation was passed giving rise to what has become known as 529 Plans, referring to Internal Revenue Code Section 529, which allows these plans.</p>
  <p>Simply stated, 529 Plans provide individuals a tax-advantaged option for saving for college. Initially, 529 Plans were not widely publicized; however, they have become an increasingly popular option in the last few years. Every state now has a 529 Plan. Against the backdrop of traditional funding alternatives, Section 529 Plans are particularly appealing, due to higher contribution limits for tax-deferred accumulation and greater donor control over the assets in the account compared to the other vehicles.</p>
