<p>Although every state Prepaid Plan is somewhat unique, there are some common provisions. To gain a deeper understanding of this type of 529 Plan, let's examine some of the typical provisions more closely.</p>

<p>Most plans provide contracts for at least four years of university study, two years of community college, and a combination program of two years community college and two years of university. Other types of contracts may also be available, including those that provide for a specific number of credits or hours.</p>

<p>Plans will cover tuition and fees for the type of contract purchased. Also generally covered are books, supplies and equipment. Some Plans will even cover certain levels of room and board.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p align="left">Plans will pay the full expenses covered under the contract purchased for in-state public schools. For attendance at private or out-of-state public schools, generally the weighted average tuition for all in-state public schools is paid. The weighted average calculation will be based on the attendance at each in-state public college.</p>
<p align="left">For example, suppose there are three public schools in a state, all with the same attendance, but with differing annual tuition charges of $3,000, $4,000, and $5,000. If a student decides to go to the most expensive public school, then the plan would pay the full $5,000. But if the student chooses to attend a private college or out-of-state school, the plan will only pay $4,000, the weighted average tuition amount of the three public schools.</p>

<p>At the time of contract purchase, the purchaser has options regarding how payments will be made. The normal choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One lump sum contribution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annual or monthly payments for a set period of years or until the student is expected to start school</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>There are fees that apply to contracts. An application fee is almost always charged. Other fees that may be levied under certain circumstances include late fees for the tardy receipt of required payments and fees if you request a change in certain contract provisions. There will also normally be a fee charged if you request the contract be canceled.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_6" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Under certain circumstances, refunds from the plan may be requested. These circumstances include contract cancellation, death, disability, or the receipt of a scholarship by the student. The amount of the refund will generally be the amount the purchaser paid for the contract plus investment earnings. For contract cancellation, Federal income taxes and a 10% Federal tax penalty will apply on the earnings.</p>
