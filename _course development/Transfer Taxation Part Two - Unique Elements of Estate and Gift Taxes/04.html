<h2>Gift Tax Deductions/Exclusions</h2>

<p>Fortunately, not every gift to an individual is taxable. We have discussed elsewhere two deductions that apply to both lifetime gifts and estates at death:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><strong>Charitable Deductions</strong> &ndash; Transfers to qualified charities, during one&rsquo;s lifetime or at death, receive an offsetting deduction, which removes them from computation of gift and estate taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Unlimited Marital Deduction</strong> &ndash; An unlimited amount can be transferred between U.S. citizen spouses, during life or at death, fully protected from transfer taxes. However, there is no unlimited marital deduction available for a transfer to a Spouse who is not a U.S. citizen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these, there are four exclusions that are specific to lifetime gifts:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><strong>The Annual Gift Tax Exclusion</strong> &ndash; This allows for annual gifts up to a specified amount to as many individuals as desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Payment of Tuition</strong> &ndash; As long as specific rules are followed, tuition payments on behalf of someone else are not taxable gifts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Payment of Medical Care</strong> &ndash; Similarly, by following specific rules, payment care payments on behalf of someone else are not taxable gifts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No lifetime gifts that qualify for one of these three exclusions or for the charitable or marital deduction are considered taxable gifts. Since these five gifts are <em>not</em> considered taxable gifts, we do not even have to use any of our Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount to protect them from taxation.</p>
<p>On the following pages, we explore these four gift tax exclusions more thoroughly.</p>
