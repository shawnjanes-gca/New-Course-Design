    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Fortunately, not  every gift to an individual is taxable. We have discussed elsewhere two  deductions that apply to both lifetime gifts and estates at death:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Charitable Deductions</strong> – Transfers to qualified charities, during one's lifetime       or at death, receive an offsetting deduction, which removes them from computation of gift and estate taxes. </li>
  
    <li><strong>The Unlimited Marital Deduction</strong> – An unlimited amount can be transferred       between U.S. citizen spouses, during life or at death, fully protected from transfer taxes. However, there is no unlimited marital deduction available for a transfer to a Spouse who is not a U.S. citizen.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to  these, there are four exclusions that are specific to lifetime gifts:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>The Annual Gift Tax Exclusion</strong> – This allows for annual gifts up to a specified amount to as many individuals as desired. </li>
  
    <li><strong>Direct Payment of Tuition</strong> – As long as specific rules are followed, tuition       payments on behalf of someone else are not taxable gifts.</li>
  
    <li><strong>Direct Payment of Medical Care</strong> – Similarly, by following specific rules,       payment care payments on behalf of someone else are not taxable gifts.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>No lifetime gifts that qualify for one of these three exclusions or for the charitable or marital  deduction are considered taxable gifts. Since these five gifts are <em>not</em> considered taxable gifts, we do not  even have to use any of our Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount to protect them  from taxation. </p>
On the following pages, we  explore these four gift tax exclusions more thoroughly.
