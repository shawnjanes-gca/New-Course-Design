<p>We now turn our attention from gifts to the settlement of estates when people die. To understand characteristics unique to estates, it is important to understand what is included in the gross estate and how it is calculated. In calculating the gross estate, don't confuse the taxable estate with the <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s">probate estate</a></strong>. The probate process involves the court supervision of the administration of the will, payment of creditors, changing titles to property, and the distribution to heirs. The estate tax process includes all the assets that are probated, but there are other assets that are owned by the deceased that do not go through probate, yet are included in the estate tax return. Primary examples are life insurance, retirement accounts, jointly owned property, and various trusts.</p>
<p>The first step in computing the estate tax is to identify all assets that are included in the <strong>gross estate</strong> (before adjustments) and record them on Form 706 (the form used for the Estate Tax Return). Essentially, everything owned by the deceased person is included in the gross estate.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it is easy to identify what is owned by the deceased: cash, stocks, bonds, automobile, real estate in the deceased name, and personal property like clothes and furniture. But some items are not as readily apparent. To get a better understanding of other assets that will be included, the next page depicts the section in Form 706 that totals the gross estate. Be sure to move the mouse pointer to each of the highlighted items on the form, which will provide commentary regarding details with which you should be aware.</p>
