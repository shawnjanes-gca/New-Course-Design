<p>This course is part of a three-part series on federal taxation for Estate Planning. The first course examined the history of federal transfer taxes and the fundamental elements that are shared by both gift and estate taxes. This course builds upon the first by examining first what is unique about the taxation of gifts and then examining what is unique about the taxation of estates. The third course, which concludes this series, will examine Generation- Skipping Transfer taxes and specific elements of income taxes that are relevant to estate planning. The material in this course, along with the other two in the series, should be considered as prerequisite to any study of estate planning techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
