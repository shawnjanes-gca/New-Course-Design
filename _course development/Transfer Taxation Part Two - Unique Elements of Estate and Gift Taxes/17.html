  <p>Having looked at both the gift tax calculation and the estate tax calculation, there is one final point to be made on how their calculations differ. It is best understood by looking at an example, such as the one below:</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
    <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
     <p> For the sake of illustration, let's assume it is 2016 and  Mr. Johnson has already made sizeable lifetime taxable gifts of $5,430,000 and  has completely used up his Applicable Credit Amount. He has also already made  annual exclusion gifts to his relatives (including his nephew) in 2015, so any  further lifetime gifts to them will be taxable gifts, which will be taxed at 40%.</p>
     <p> Let's further assume he is seriously ill and expects to die  before year-end. In his will, he plans to leave $100,000 to his nephew. His  question is this: "Is there any advantage to gifting the $100,000 to my nephew  now, rather than waiting until I die?"</p>
     <p> At first glance, it would appear to make no difference. If  he makes the gift while alive, he will pay at the tax rate of 40%. If he waits  for his estate to make the transfer upon his death, it too will pay at the tax  rate of 40%. Since both transfers get taxed at the same rate, aren't the  results the same?  To see, let's walk  through both scenarios and make the calculations. </p>
  <p><strong>Distribution during lifetime.</strong> Since the gift  tax must be paid by the donor, Mr. Johnson gives his nephew $100,000 and allocates  $40,000 to pay the gift tax. Total cost of the transfer = $140,000.  </p>
  <p><strong>Distribution at death.</strong> What would happen with  that same $140,000 if he retained it in his estate? Well, the $140,000 would be  subject to estate taxes at 40%. This gives a tax of $56,000 and leaves a  balance of $84,000 vs. $100,000 for his nephew. The IRS got more in taxes,  requiring additional funds to be allocated if the nephew is to receive the full  $100,000. How come?</p>
  
  </div>
<p>The reason that the lifetime gift was more tax-efficient than the estate transfer is explained by the following: </p>
<div class="explanation-widget-box">
  <p><strong><em>Gifts are "tax exclusive,"</em></strong> meaning the funds used to pay the  gift tax are excluded from the tax base. In our example of the lifetime gift,  we computed the tax on the $100,000 gift, not on the entire $140,000, so the  money used to pay the tax was not part of the base upon which we computed the  tax bill. In fact, no tax was ever computed on the $40,000 that went to the IRS,  so it got excluded from transfer taxation.</p>
 <p> <strong><em>Estates are "tax  inclusive,"</em></strong> meaning the funds used to pay the estate tax are included in the tax basis. In  our example of the distribution at death, we computed the estate tax on the  entire $140,000, so the money used to pay the estate tax was part of the base  upon which we computed the tax bill. Thus, in estates, everything gets included  in transfer taxation; even the funds that are used to pay the tax get included  in being taxed.</p>
 </div>
<p>If you find this is somewhat like understanding Einstein's theory of relativity, don't worry about it. The important thing to remember is that the taxation of lifetime gifts is more favorable than the taxation of estates because of the manner in which the calculation is done. If given a choice between making a taxable transfer as a lifetime gift or through the estate, it is more tax efficient to make the lifetime gift.</p>
  <p>However, there is one caveat. To prevent people from making "death bed" transfers, thereby achieving a lower gift tax than would be achieved by the estate tax upon death, the IRS requires that gift taxes paid within three years of death must be added back to the estate and thereby becomes part of the tax base. In this way, the money used to pay the gift tax is now included in a "tax inclusive" manner with the estate tax calculation, thereby negating the tax savings that was achieved by the lifetime transfer within three years of death. So, in our illustration of Mr. Johnson, it ends up there is no advantage in making the lifetime gift because he is not expected to live for three years after making the transfer.</p>
