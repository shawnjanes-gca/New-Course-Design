  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Annual Gift Tax Exclusion </span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>For  2016, lifetime gifts of a present interest in the amount of <strong>$14,000 or less </strong>can  be made <strong>annually to any individual,</strong> and are <strong>excluded </strong>from the  gift tax. Note that the gift tax exclusion is not limited to gifts to family  members; it applies to gifts to ANY INDIVIDUAL.</p>
  <p>For a gift to qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion, the  IRS requires that the gift must be of a "<strong><em>present interest.</em></strong>"  In other words, the person receiving the gift  must enjoy an immediate benefit and the unrestricted right to use, possess and  enjoy the property.  No annual exclusion  will be granted for a "<strong><em>future interest</em></strong>" where the right to use  and enjoy the property does not take place until some future time.  Nor will it be granted for an interest that  is "<strong><em>contingent</em></strong>" upon the occurrence of an event or subject to the  discretion of another person.  There are,  however, some exceptions that make it possible to make annual exclusion gifts  to minors, even though someone else will manage and apply the funds for the  benefit of the minor until the minor reaches adulthood.</p>
<p>This provides a significant ability for individuals with taxable estates to effectively transfer assets out of their estates without incurring a transfer tax. What is especially important to remember is that since annual exclusion gifts are not "taxable gifts," they do not get added back to the estate upon the death of the donor. The gifted assets and all future appreciation on the assets are forever out of the donor's estate.  Given sufficient <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Person or institution to whom a gift is made.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">donees</a> and sufficient years to make transfers, sizeable amounts can effectively avoid taxation. </p>

The indexing is rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $1,000, meaning it may be a number of years between changes. For 2012, it was $13,000; it increased to $14,000 in 2013 and has remained at $14,000 through 2016. </p>
