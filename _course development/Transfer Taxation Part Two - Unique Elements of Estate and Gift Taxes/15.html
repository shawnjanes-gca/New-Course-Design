  <p>Depending upon the state in which you reside, state transfer taxes may also impact the tax cost of transfers. Only a handful of states have a gift tax, but one or more of the following may be found in any given state.  Therefore, it is important to discern the practices in a client's state and any additional state taxes should be taken into consideration. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each type of death tax to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>When Congress permanently instituted an estate tax in 1916,  states were upset because this infringed upon their traditional tax base. In  response, Congress instituted a credit against the federal tax for death taxes  paid to states. Since the state "<strong>pick up</strong>" tax equaled the  credit allowed, there was no impact on the total tax bill paid by the decedent.  The only result was that part of the tax revenue was shared with the state in  which the decedent was domiciled. </p>
              <p>The Tax Relief Act of 2001 began phasing away this credit. Beginning in 2002, this credit was reduced by 25% per year and it disappeared totally for deaths occurring in 2005.</p>
              <p>A deduction on the federal estate tax return for state-imposed estate or inheritance taxes replaced the credit on the federal estate tax return for 2005 and after.  Since the change in the federal law, a number of states have enacted their own estate tax laws to replace the pickup tax. </p>

              <p>An <strong>inheritance tax</strong> is the oldest form of death tax, although most states no longer  levy it. It is typically levied at a graduated rate based on the amount of the  bequest and the relationship to the deceased of the person receiving the  bequest. In all states, bequests to spouses are exempt from the inheritance  tax. Some states even exempt children and close relatives. In general, the  closer the relationship was with the deceased, the less the tax.</p>
