  <p>Not all lifetime transfers of property qualify as gifts for gift tax purposes. Generally speaking, a lifetime transfer is considered a gift if four conditions are met: <span class="pageInstruction">Move the mouse pointer to each item to learn more.</span></p>
  <ol style="width:95%">
  	<li><span><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Just as minors need a guardian or other entity such as a trust to hold property on their behalf, so do adults who are incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1"><strong>Both parties are competent adults</strong></a></span></li>
    <li><span><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;As the IRS Code states, the transfer must be &quot;for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.&quot; If payment for the full value of the transfer is received, it is not a gift. If partial payment is received with no requirement for further payment, then it is a partial gift of the balance. For example, selling your $500,000 house to your child for $300,000 is a gift of $200,000.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2"><strong>It is not an equal value exchange</strong></a></span></li>
    <li><span><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;This means that actual receipt of the asset was taken or title to the property was changed. It also means that no strings are attached whereby the donor retains control or use of the asset. In the latter case, such gifts are considered incomplete. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the donor who sells her house to her child for less than adequate consideration and &lt;strong&gt;continues to live there rent-free&lt;/strong&gt; has not made a completed gift.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3"><strong>It is a completed transfer</strong></a></span></li>
    <li><span><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;irrevocable&quot; means that once it is done, it cannot be changed; in other words, once the gift is made, the donor cannot change his or her mind and take it back.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4"><strong>The Transfer is irrevocable</strong></a></span></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Given these conditions, many things can qualify as a gift:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Gifts of cash </li>
    <li>Gifts of investment securities, such as stocks or bonds </li>
    <li>Forgiveness of a loan </li>
    <li>Purchasing an automobile or computer as a graduation present </li>
    <li>Creation of certain types of trust for the benefit of someone else </li>
  </ul>
<p>But  sometimes it is not completely clear if a gift has been made, or when it is  complete. For example, setting up a joint checking account with someone else.  Does that constitute a gift? What if the other person withdraws the money?  Another example might be a transfer of real estate where the donor retains the  right to use the real estate during the donor's lifetime. Is that a completed  gift, in whole or in part? </p>

<p>A full analysis of such situations is beyond the scope of  this training module. Simply remember that <strong>any  transfer where the donor retains some control or current interest in the asset  may not qualify as a gift</strong> and would remain in the taxable estate of the  donor. For such situations, a specialist should be involved. </p>
