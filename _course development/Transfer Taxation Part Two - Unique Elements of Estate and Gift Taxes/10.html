    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Here is the section of Form 706 where the gross estate is calculated. Some of the items are self-explanatory; others are not. To establish a foundation for understanding the estate planning process, it is important that you have some understanding of each of these items. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each of the highlighted sections for more information on those items that are not readily apparent:</span></p>

      <area shape="rect" coords="64,132,609,155" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule D. Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; It is common sense that if insurance proceeds on the life of  the deceased (who is legally referred to as the &quot;decedent&quot;) are payable to the  estate, then the proceeds are included in the gross estate. But it would  surprise many people to know that even where insurance proceeds are paid out to  beneficiaries and the estate receives nothing, the estate must report the full  amount of the insurance on the estate tax return if the deceased owned the  policy. This is why many people have taxable estates that are beyond the  Applicable Exclusion Amount, even though they don't realize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRS says any of the following incidents of ownership  will qualify the deceased as owning the policy and include it in the deceased's  estate, even if the deceased could not act independently but had to act in  conjunction with another person. The incidents of ownership in a policy as  outlined by the IRS include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The right of the insured or estate to its economic benefits &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The power to change beneficiaries &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The power to surrender or cancel the policy &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The power to assign a policy or to revoke an assignment &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The power to pledge the policy for a loan &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The power to obtain from the insurer a loan against the cash value of the policy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, if the deceased had any power whatsoever over the  policy, the amount of the proceeds is included in the deceased's estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the inclusion of  life insurance in a person's estate, a common planning technique is to  establish an irrevocable trust, which will either purchase a new policy or to  which an existing policy will be transferred.   The trust, commonly known as an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust, will  be both the owner and beneficiary of the policy, thereby keeping ownership out  of the person's estate.  However, as  discussed under Schedule G, please note that transfers of insurance within  three years of death must be added back to the estate.  Therefore, if an existing policy is  transferred to an irrevocable trust, rather than the trust purchasing a new  policy, the transferring owner must live for three years beyond the transfer  for the policy to be excluded from his or her estate.&lt;/p&gt;">

      <area shape="rect" coords="64,156,609,180" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule E. Jointly-Owned Property&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more thorough discussion of jointly owned property is contained in a separate module. For our purposes here, simply know that jointly owned property is included in the estate to the extent of the deceased’s interest in the property.&lt;/p&gt;">

      <area shape="rect" coords="63,180,608,200" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule F. Other Miscellaneous Property&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a catchall for items not listed elsewhere. It would include such things as the deceased's automobile, household goods and personal effects, jewelry, and art collections. It might also include such items as interests in a business, royalties, and livestock.&lt;/p&gt;">

      <area shape="rect" coords="62,202,608,221" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="<p><strong>Schedule G. Transfers During Decedent's Life</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;decedent&quot; is the legal term for the deceased.</p>
<p>For certain transfers, if the decedent made the transfer  within 3 years of death, then the assets are still included in the decedent's  estate.  This applies to Life  Insurance.  Thus, to successfully transfer  life insurance out of your estate, you must transfer it to another individual  or irrevocable trust, and then live for three more years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the decedent had incomplete transfers of  property, where he/she retained certain rights over the property, then the  property is generally included in the decedent's estate. Examples of incomplete  transfers would include retained powers to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine solely or with another person who had right to use of the property </li>
  <li>Determine solely or with another person who had right to income from the property </li>
  <li>Use the property or collect income for oneself </li>
  <li>Vote the shares</li></ul>">

&lt;p&gt;If the decedent (deceased) had a general power of appointment over property that he/she did not own, that property is included in his/her estate. This is usually associated with a trust that was established by someone other than the decedent. Having a general power over the assets means that the deceased had the power to appoint the assets to himself, his estate, or his creditors. In other words, the general power gave him the power to use the assets as he wished, even though they were not titled in his name.&lt;/p&gt;">
