<h4>D. Insurance.</h4>
<p>It is common sense that if insurance proceeds on the life of the deceased (who is legally referred to as the "decedent") are payable to the estate, then the proceeds are included in the gross estate. But it would surprise many people to know that even where insurance proceeds are paid out to beneficiaries and the estate receives nothing, the estate must report the full amount of the insurance on the estate tax return if the deceased owned the policy. This is why many people have taxable estates that are beyond the Applicable Exclusion Amount, even though they don't realize it.</p>
<p>The IRS says any of the following incidents of ownership will qualify the deceased as owning the policy and include it in the deceased's estate, even if the deceased could not act independently but had to act in conjunction with another person. The incidents of ownership in a policy as outlined by the IRS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right of the insured or estate to its economic benefits</li>
<li>The power to change beneficiaries</li>
<li>The power to surrender or cancel the policy</li>
<li>The power to assign a policy or to revoke an assignment</li>
<li>The power to pledge the policy for a loan</li>
<li>The power to obtain from the insurer a loan against the cash value of the policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, if the deceased had any power whatsoever over the policy, the amount of the proceeds is included in the deceased's estate.</p>
<p>To avoid the inclusion of life insurance in a person&rsquo;s estate, a common planning technique is to establish an irrevocable trust, which will either purchase a new policy or to which an existing policy will be transferred. The trust, commonly known as an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust, will be both the owner and beneficiary of the policy, thereby keeping ownership out of the person&rsquo;s estate. However, as discussed under Schedule G, please note that transfers of insurance within three years of death must be added back to the estate. Therefore, if an existing policy is transferred to an irrevocable trust, rather than the trust purchasing a new policy, the transferring owner must live for three years beyond the transfer for the policy to be excluded from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>I. Annuities.</h4>
<p>The estate includes any annuity proceeds that are payable to the decedent's (the deceased's) estate. Also, if there are funds that will go to a surviving beneficiary, to the degree that those funds are due to contributions by the decedent and his/her employer, then to that degree those funds are included in the decedent's estate. This would include qualified retirement plans and IRAs.</p>

<h4>H. Powers of Appointment.</h4>
<p>If the decedent (deceased) had a general power of appointment over property that he/she did not own, that property is included in his/her estate. This is usually associated with a trust that was established by someone other than the decedent. Having a general power over the assets means that the deceased had the power to appoint the assets to himself, his estate, or his creditors. In other words, the general power gave him the power to use the assets as he wished, even though they were not titled in his name.</p>

<h4>G. Transfers During Decedent's Life.</h4>
<p>The term "decedent" is the legal term for the deceased.</p>
<p>For certain transfers, if the decedent made the transfer within 3 years of death, then the assets are still included in the decedent&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; This applies to Life Insurance.&nbsp; Thus, to successfully transfer life insurance out of your estate, you must transfer it to another individual or irrevocable trust, and then live for three more years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the decedent had incomplete transfers of property, where he/she retained certain rights over the property, then the property is generally included in the decedent&rsquo;s estate. Examples of incomplete transfers would include retained powers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine solely or with another person who had right to use of the property</li>
<li>Determine solely or with another person who had right to income from the property</li>
<li>Use the property or collect income for oneself</li>
<li>Vote the shares</li>
