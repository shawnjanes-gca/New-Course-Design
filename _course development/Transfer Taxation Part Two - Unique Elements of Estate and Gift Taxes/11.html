  </h1>
  <p>In determining the value of property that is included in the  estate tax return, valuation can either be at the time of death or an election  can be made to use the <strong>alternate valuation date</strong>, which is <strong>6 months  after death</strong>. But the alternate valuation date can only be used if it  results in lower taxes. Any assets that are distributed or sold prior to the  alternate valuation date will use the value at which they were distributed or sold. </p>
<p>All valuations must be at fair market value. Determining a fair market value is not always simple. While beyond the scope of this course, be aware that there are many rules regarding how to determine the value of various assets. </p>
