  </h1>
  <p>Having examined in some detail what is included in the gross estate, let's examine how the tax is computed. The basic structure of the estate tax is outlined below. Unless you plan to file complete estate tax returns, it is not important that you memorize every step in the process. But it is important that you note the comments on the highlighted steps. <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each of the highlighted steps.</span></p>

As we have seen, this responsibility can include payment of the tax liability for assets that were outside of probate, such as insurance proceeds that were paid directly to survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no one is appointed by the court to settle the estate, then the person in possession of the deceased person's property becomes responsible. This is why trustees often become responsible for the estate tax. Where all assets were transferred to trust prior to death and there is no probate estate, it is the trustee who possesses the funds with which the estate tax must be paid, and therefore it becomes the trustee's responsibility. This is one reason why the trustee cannot always immediately distribute funds to beneficiaries after the death of the person who created the trust.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">Estate tax due</a></td>
