  <p>Some estates may claim special estate tax benefits that result in lower taxes or allow payment of the taxes in installments. If there is a subsequent change in the circumstances that led to those tax benefits, the tax savings may be recaptured by the government or the tax installments may be accelerated. Two such situations are illustrated below. <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each for an illustration.</span></p>
  <p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Under certain circumstances, property may qualify for a &quot;special-use valuation,&quot; under Section 2032A of the tax code, which substantially reduces its value for estate tax purposes. For example, a farm might be located in an area that is rapidly undergoing residential development, with significantly higher property value. The farm may be worth much less as a farm than it would be if put on the market for residential development. For estate tax purposes, the value of the land might be adjusted downward from its market value due to its special use, with the maximum adjustment for real property being $1,110,000 in 2016 (adjusted for inflation from $750,000 in 1997). Current rules state that if the heirs cease to use the property in its qualified use within 10 years of the decedent's death, then the estate tax savings from special use must be recaptured.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Special Use Valuation</a></p>
  <p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Estates with an interest in a closely-held business, the value of which exceeds 35% of the adjusted gross estate, may qualify for payment of the estate tax in installments. But if more than 50% of the value of the closely-held business is disposed of before completion of those installment payments, the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments must be paid upon notice and demand of the Treasury Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Installment Payments of Estate Taxes for Estates with an Interest in a Closely-Held Business</a></p>
