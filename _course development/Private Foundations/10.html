  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Charitable Goals to Consider</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Many clients, particularly those who have not previously considered a private foundation, may be relatively unclear in their own minds as to their charitable goals. While this can present something of a challenge, there are several rules of thumb, or key items to look for. The following is a brief list of some of these key items:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>Key Charitable Goals</h3>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li><span>A desire to create a unique and perhaps permanent legacy;</span></li>
      <li><span>A desire to teach their values and share their vision with children/grandchildren;</span></li>
      <li><span>A desire to maintain flexibility to adapt charitable activities as the client learns more and as circumstances change;</span></li>
      <li><span>An interest in maintaining legal control over charitable assets;</span></li>
      <li><span>The desire to give, yet remain anonymous;</span></li>
      <li><span>A desire, whether articulated or not, to &quot;make a difference.&quot;</span></li>
    </ol>
