     <h3>Case Study 2 -  Benefit of Gifting Long-Term Appreciated Stocks</h3>
      <p> In case study 1, Mr. Johanssen was assumed to have given  cash. The income tax benefit would be  even greater if he instead used long-term appreciated stock.</p>
	<p>For the sake of example, assume that his $300,000 contribution consists of $200,000 of stock (long-term  appreciated property is limited to 20% of Contribution Base, which is typically 20% of AGI), which has a basis of $50,000, and $100,000 in cash. His income tax deduction is still $300,000,  and saves him $135,000 of income taxes as in case study 1. But he also avoids a capital gains tax on the  $150,000 of unrealized appreciation. Given a 20% capital gains rate, he saves another $30,000 of income taxes.</p> </div>
