<p><strong><em>Case Study 2 - Benefit of Gifting Long-Term Appreciated Stocks</em></strong></p>
<p>In case study 1, Mr. Johanssen was assumed to have given cash. The income tax benefit would be even greater if he instead used long-term appreciated stock.</p>
<p>For the sake of example, assume that his $300,000 contribution consists of $200,000 of stock (long-term appreciated property is limited to 20% of Contribution Base, which is typically 20% of AGI), which has a basis of $50,000, and $100,000 in cash.&nbsp; His income tax deduction is still $300,000, and saves him $135,000 of income taxes as in case study 1.&nbsp; But he also avoids a capital gains tax on the $150,000 of unrealized appreciation.&nbsp; Given a 20% capital gains rate, he saves another $30,000 of income taxes.</p>
