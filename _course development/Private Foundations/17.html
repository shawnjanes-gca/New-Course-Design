  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Prohibition on Jeopardy Investments</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>To prevent private foundations from jeopardizing their  principal through excessively risky investments, so-called &quot;jeopardizing  investments&quot; are prohibited. While the law does not provide a &quot;bright  line&quot; test, this rule is not especially stringent and will usually not  constrain any reasonably prudent, diversified investment approach.</p>
<p>For example, <strong><em>even fairly unconventional investments  such as futures, options, warrants, hedge funds, and the like may be allowed,</em></strong> but can be subjected to special scrutiny by the IRS<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup>. If the  client's foundation desires to invest in such assets, it would be advisable to  consult an expert in advance and have adequate documentation prepared. </p>
<p><strong><em>A  related issue is margin trading. While not strictly prohibited, it is highly  inadvisable in a private foundation.</em></strong> While the IRS does not strictly prohibit such margin  trading in a foundation account, founders/directors could be personally  responsible for any losses incurred while trading on margin. In other words,  the risk/reward to such investing in a foundation account is lopsided against  the founders/directors (if they make money, the foundation will get the benefit;  if they lose money, they may be personally liable to the foundation for the  loss). Even if the loss has nothing to do with the margining in the account,  the founders/directors put themselves at risk for any loss. Thus, the prudent  course is to avoid margin trading. </p>
