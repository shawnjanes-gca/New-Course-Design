<p>To prevent private foundations from jeopardizing their principal through excessively risky investments, so-called "jeopardizing investments" are prohibited. While the law does not provide a "bright line" test, this rule is not especially stringent and will usually not constrain any reasonably prudent, diversified investment approach.</p>
<p>For example, <em><strong>even fairly unconventional investments such as futures, options, warrants, hedge funds, and the like may be allowed,</strong></em> but can be subjected to special scrutiny by the IRS<sup>1</sup>. If the client's foundation desires to invest in such assets, it would be advisable to consult an expert in advance and have adequate documentation prepared.</p>
<p><strong><em>A related issue is margin trading. While not strictly prohibited, it is highly inadvisable in a private foundation.</em></strong> While the IRS does not strictly prohibit such margin trading in a foundation account, founders/directors could be personally responsible for any losses incurred while trading on margin. In other words, the risk/reward to such investing in a foundation account is lopsided against the founders/directors (if they make money, the foundation will get the benefit; if they lose money, they may be personally liable to the foundation for the loss). Even if the loss has nothing to do with the margining in the account, the founders/directors put themselves at risk for any loss. Thus, the prudent course is to avoid margin trading.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><sup><span style="font-size: xx-small;">1</span></sup><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The IRS has, for example, approved investments in nontraditional areas. See PLR 9451067</span></span></p>
