      <li><span><strong>Decide the initial funding.</strong> Creating a foundation in one year does not obligate the founder to contribute to it in future years.</span></li>
   	  <li><span><strong>Decide what to call the foundation.</strong> Almost any name will work,  provided it is available. Quite often, the founder's name or family name is used.</span></li>
   </ol>
