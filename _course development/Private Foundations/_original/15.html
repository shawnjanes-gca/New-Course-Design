<h2>Rules Against Self-Dealing</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Broadly speaking, the prohibition on self-dealing [Section 4941] means that <em><strong>disqualified persons</strong></em> [Section 4946] - generally the founder and lineal descendants and antecedents (e.g. parents and children), and people under their employment - may not engage in any transactions with the foundation, except to make donations to it or, under limited circumstances, to receive fair market value compensation for services [Section 4941(d)2].</p>
<p>In general, a donor is never permitted to receive an improper benefit from a charity he or she supports. In the private foundation arena, these rules are spelled out in some detail.&nbsp; A few key rules that founders should be aware of:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="greene/foundations/disqual_person.gif" alt="" width="506" height="165" /></p>
<p>A disqualified person is permitted to have certain, arm's-length dealings with the foundation. For example, the founder and his/her family may receive reasonable director's fees (provided that they do not receive preferential treatment), and the donor and/or family members may be employed, provided that their compensation is reasonable for work actually performed. Specific situations may require specific legal advice.</p>
