<div align="left"><strong>Personal Satisfaction</strong> - Personal satisfaction is perhaps the single overriding reason why the people ultimately create private foundations. Although relatively few donors will come right out and admit it, most tend to be very appreciative of the attention, social status and other intangible rewards which are associated with being known in the community as a significant donor. Private foundations maximize this recognition because, as a named corporate entity, they provide perpetual name recognition for those with long-term philanthropic intent. Of course, deep, lasting satisfaction also comes from making a difference in people's lives.</div>

<div align="left"><strong>Flexibility</strong> - Unlike all other alternatives for charitable giving, private foundations allow their creators to maintain maximum flexibility. Since donors retain control over the way that their assets are invested, when money will be given to charity, which charities money is given to, and how much, the private foundation enables donors to adapt their charitable behavior as their needs and circumstances dictate.</div>

<div align="left"><strong>Control</strong> - Control of assets is very important for most high net worth individuals. In many cases, this carries over into their charitable activities as well. The private foundation rules allow a foundation creator to retain complete legal control over the foundation and its assets during life, and to pass that control to chosen successors in perpetuity. It is for this reason, probably more than any other, that private foundations continue to be the vehicle of choice for most wealthy donors.</div>

<p><strong>"Buy Time"</strong> - The great majority of successful people have a strong desire and commitment to give something back to society, in one form or another. Most currently give to one or more charities, or plan to do so in the future when they get a little more time to focus on that aspect of their lives. But busy people often face a dilemma. They need a tax deduction this year, but are not yet prepared to make major commitments to specific charities. A private foundation makes it possible to do both. They can get a tax deduction now; yet "buy time" to decide later (even years from now) how to best spend their charitable dollars.</p>
<p>Large gifts to charity are serious business and they deserve thoughtful attention. The flexibility of a private foundation, and the requirement that the foundation give only five percent of its assets each year to charity, enable donors to take advantage of the tax breaks, yet still provide themselves with the opportunity over time to devote the attention that large gifts deserve.</p>

<div align="left"><strong>Involve Family with Charitable Intent </strong>- Many people use private foundations as a way to communicate and instill common values and ideals in their children and grandchildren by involving them with the management and administration of the foundation. The formal structure of a private foundation provides a very natural framework for involving children, for example, as directors. Many foundation creators choose to involve their children informally for a period during which they evaluate each child's level of interest, involvement and commitment. There are, of course, many different approaches and no single approach can be said to be right for all founders. In some cases, the children may become seriously involved and the foundation directors may choose to pay these children reasonable salaries for the work they perform.</div>
