<p>While a private foundation is a very powerful tax-saving tool, it is not for everybody. Generally speaking, in most cases a client should have at least a net worth of $5 million or annual income of $500,000 to be considered a likely candidate for a private foundation during life. Additionally, due to the setup and administrative costs involved, in most cases a client should expect to fund his foundation eventually with at least $500,000 in order to be considered a likely candidate. However, the client need not plan to put the full half-million in immediately.</p>
