<h4>Case Study 4 - The Estate Tax Advantage</h4>
<p>Continuing to explore Mr. Johansenn's situation, suppose he dies at the end of year 27 and leaves no additional assets to charity. Also suppose he has used up his Applicable Credit by making lifetime gifts to children. Assuming current (2016) law, then estate taxes would take approximately 40% of the amounts not in the foundation when Mr. Johansenn dies. The amount in the foundation would not be affected by estate taxes. If he had not funded the foundation during life and waited to contribute 25% of his estate upon death, he would leave 25% of $33.3 million, or $8.3 million to his foundation. Ignoring any tax exclusion that might be available to him, that would leave a taxable estate of $25 million, of which the estate tax would take approximately 40% or $10 million. This leaves just $15 million to his heirs.</p>
<p>In contrast, by funding the foundation annually, the foundation already has $16.3 million, almost twice as much as if he had waited until death. At his death, he leaves his entire estate of $28.4 million, less tax, to his heirs. After paying estate taxes of $11.3 million, the heirs receive $17.1 million, <em>more than they would have received had he waited until his death to fund the foundation.</em></p>
