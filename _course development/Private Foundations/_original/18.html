<blockquote>
<p>Private foundations are required to distribute a certain amount of assets to qualified public charities each year. Generally, the amount is approximately 5% of average net assets, less certain foundation costs and expenses such as certain legal and investment management fees. Generally, the distributions must be made in the year following the year upon which they are based. This assures that there is time to calculate the required amounts and make effective decisions as to where to give the required distributions.</p>
<p>In addition to these constraints, there are a number of additional rules and requirements regarding how a foundation is operated, what tax, and other reporting it must do.</p>
