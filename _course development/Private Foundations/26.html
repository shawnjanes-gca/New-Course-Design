  <h1><span class="pagetitle">How to Set Up a Private Foundation</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Starting a Private Foundation does require experience and clear understanding of the tax and regulatory issues involved. Historically, some people have tried a "do-it-yourself" approach involving a combination of personal effort and the use of required professionals such as attorneys and accountants. Some version of "do-it-yourself" has been the most popular choice, because full-service management was hard to find or because a bank trust company was not desirable for one or more reasons. </p>
  <p>But "do-it-yourself" places a heavy burden on the founder and directors. Because of the complexity of running an effective foundation, a "do-it-yourself" foundation is very likely to be run at best inefficiently and at worst is a violation of the rules. Alternatively, a full service foundation management firm or bank trust company can be hired.</p>
  <p>Regardless of the route chosen, the first steps to take with clients wishing to establish a private foundation are to:</p>
