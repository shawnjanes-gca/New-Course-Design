              <p>Personal  satisfaction is perhaps the single overriding reason why the people ultimately  create private foundations. Although relatively few donors will come right out  and admit it, most tend to be very appreciative of the attention, social status  and other intangible rewards which are associated with being known in the  community as a significant donor. Private foundations maximize this recognition  because, as a named corporate entity, they provide perpetual name recognition  for those with long-term philanthropic intent. Of course, deep, lasting  satisfaction also comes from making a difference in people's lives.</p>

              <p>Unlike  all other alternatives for charitable giving, private foundations allow their  creators to maintain maximum flexibility. Since donors retain control over the  way that their assets are invested, when money will be given to charity, which  charities money is given to, and how much, the private foundation enables  donors to adapt their charitable behavior as their needs and circumstances  dictate.</p>

              <p>Control  of assets is very important for most high net worth individuals. In many cases,  this carries over into their charitable activities as well. The private  foundation rules allow a foundation creator to retain complete legal control  over the foundation and its assets during life, and to pass that control to  chosen successors in perpetuity. It is for this reason, probably more than any  other, that private foundations continue to be the vehicle of choice for most  wealthy donors.</p>

              <p>The great majority of successful people have a strong desire  and commitment to give something back to society, in one form or another. Most  currently give to one or more charities, or plan to do so in the future when  they get a little more time to focus on that aspect of their lives. But busy  people often face a dilemma. They need a tax deduction this year, but are not  yet prepared to make major commitments to specific charities. A private  foundation makes it possible to do both. They can get a tax deduction now; yet  &quot;buy time&quot; to decide later (even years from now) how to best spend  their charitable dollars.</p>
              <p>Large gifts to charity are serious business and they deserve thoughtful attention. The flexibility of a private foundation, and the requirement that the foundation give only five percent of its assets each year to charity, enable donors to take advantage of the tax breaks, yet still provide themselves with the opportunity over time to devote the attention that large gifts deserve.</p>

              <p>Many  people use private foundations as a way to communicate and instill common  values and ideals in their children and grandchildren by involving them with  the management and administration of the foundation. The formal structure of a  private foundation provides a very natural framework for involving children,  for example, as directors. Many foundation creators choose to involve their  children informally for a period during which they evaluate each child's level  of interest, involvement and commitment. There are, of course, many different  approaches and no single approach can be said to be right for all founders. In  some cases, the children may become seriously involved and the foundation  directors may choose to pay these children reasonable salaries for the work  they perform.</p>
