  <p>The fact that the foundation is not subject to estate tax can also be tremendously important to building and sustaining assets over time. </p>

    <h3>Case Study 4 - The  Estate Tax Advantage</h3>
     <p> Continuing to explore Mr. Johansenn's situation, suppose he  dies at the end of year 27 and leaves no additional assets to charity. Also  suppose he has used up his Applicable Credit by making lifetime gifts to  children. Assuming current (2016) law, then estate taxes would take  approximately 40% of the amounts not in the foundation when Mr. Johansenn dies.  The amount in the foundation would not be affected by estate taxes. If he had  not funded the foundation during life and waited to contribute 25% of his  estate upon death, he would leave 25% of $33.3 million, or $8.3 million to his  foundation. Ignoring any tax exclusion that might be available to him, that would  leave a taxable estate of $25 million, of which the estate tax would take  approximately 40% or $10 million. This leaves just $15 million to his heirs.</p>
    <p> In contrast, by funding the foundation annually, the  foundation already has $16.3 million, almost twice as much as if he had waited  until death. At his death, he leaves his entire estate of $28.4 million, less  tax, to his heirs. After paying estate taxes of $11.3 million, the heirs  receive $17.1 million, <em>more than they  would have received had he waited until his death to fund the foundation.</em></p>
