  </h1>
  <p>While rare, there are some situations where a Private Operating Foundation may be appropriate. While similar to the Private Independent Foundation we have been referring to, the Private Operating Foundation structure is designed for those situations where the founders wish to develop and run their own programs such as education centers, counseling centers, or feed the hungry kitchens. The "operating" foundation does not have the restriction of making grants solely to not-for-profit entities. However, these foundations require significant involvement of the founder (or a staff) and have other restrictions such as the requirement to devote at least 65% of assets to "charitable purposes," distribute at least 66% of minimum investment returns to public charities, or must get <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Excluding total investment income, 85% of the support must be received from the general public and “5 or more unrelated exempt organizations” according to the IRS. Other requirements apply.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">substantially all</a> of their support from the general public.</p>
