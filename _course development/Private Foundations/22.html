  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Tax Benefits Illustrated - Case Study Analysis</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The following four case studies illustrate the most common situations in which private foundations might be used to capture tax benefits. In any given client situation, creating a foundation will usually result in both an immediate and a longer-term increase in net assets for the client and his foundation. The immediate increase results from the income tax deduction the client receives.</p>

    <h3>Case Study 1 - Income  Tax Benefit in a Single Year</h3>
	<p>Harold Johanssen is in the  45% income tax bracket (combined federal and state), has $1,000,000 of income  (AGI), and is considering whether or not to make a $300,000 contribution to his  foundation. He plans eventually to leave 25% of his estate to charity.
