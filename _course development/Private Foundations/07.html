  <div class="explanation-widget-box">Mrs. Reece Johnson has devoted many hours of her time to help raise funds for various religious and missionary organizations. With the recent sale of her technology company, she has expressed intent to "give back to the community". Her AGI for this year is $4.2 million and she expects that to stay about the same for the next 5-7 years based on royalty payments she is receiving from the sale.  She currently holds about $4 million in unrestricted stock in Seibel (SEBL) with a basis of $1.2 million and has $1.5 million in cash, the bulk of which she wishes to give to charity, but wishes to proceed in the most tax-effective manner possible.  <span class="pageInstruction">Answer the following questions</span></div>

          <div id="Layer8" class="rvAnimatedLayer">Partially Correct. While this is more advantageous than the cash gift, there is a better option if she wants to maximize the longevity and value of the gift. Try again. </div>
          <div id="Layer9" class="rvAnimatedLayer">Correct. Give as much stock as she is willing to gift in this year. This may be the most appropriate strategy if her intent is to maximize the value of her gift. First, she avoids capital gains taxes on the gift when using appreciated securities. Second, she is able to carry any unused deduction forward for up to 5 years. Third, she is able to benefit from the income tax free growth of the contribution inside the Private Foundation, thereby extending the total value of the gift over time. Fourth, the assets that are gifted to the foundation are taken out of her estate and are therefore not subject to estate taxes. As such, she has fulfilled her intent, established a potentially perpetual gifting strategy and has received extensive tax benefits, both now and into the future.</div>
          <div id="Layer10" class="rvAnimatedLayer">Incorrect. This situation is almost ideal for the use of a private foundation. Try again.</div>
