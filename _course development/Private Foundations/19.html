  <p>Even though charities generally pay no income tax, they are still required to file income tax returns with the IRS. Private foundations must file a Form 990-PF annually, in addition to certain other forms that may be required from time to time. Portions of the 990-PF are public and must be made available to the public on demand.</p>
  <p>The requirement to file tax returns means that very precise accounting is required for private foundations. Even though the amount of tax (from the 2% or 1% excise tax on <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Net investment income&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as total investment income less expenses required to collect or produce the income. Investment management fees represent an expense required to produce income.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">net investment income</a>) is almost always small, the rules still require that it be calculated properly and paid on a timely basis. </p>
