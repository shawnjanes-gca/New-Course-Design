  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Costs to Set Up and Maintain a Foundation</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The cost to set up and maintain a private foundation is the main reason most people do not use them for amounts less than $500,000. Like many professional services, the costs to create a foundation may vary considerably between providers. A typical charge to create a private foundation will exceed $20,000. </p>
  <p>Ongoing maintenance depends largely on the size and activity of the foundation. Costs may range from about one percent of assets for well-run, lean foundations, up to five percent or more. It is possible to run a foundation on a shoestring; but it is important in such cost-driven modes to pay particular attention to the full spectrum of compliance issues, some of which may be overlooked in the effort to minimize the costs of managing the foundation.</p>
