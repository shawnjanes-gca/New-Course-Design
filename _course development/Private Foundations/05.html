  <p>These limits are as follows.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each limit to learn more.</span></p>

<p>In other words, the deduction on combined contributions of all types is capped at 30% of AGI, of which no more than 20% of AGI can be for contributions of long-term appreciated property.  The deductibility of contributions beyond these limits can be carried over for 5 years.</p>
   <p>For example, a donor may get a deduction for up to 30% of AGI by giving 30% in cash.  If the donor gives long-term appreciated property instead of cash, then only 20% of AGI could be deducted.  If, however, the donor gives10% in cash and 20% in long-term appreciated property, then the combined contributions would be deductible because they do not exceed 30% of AGI [ref. Sec. 170(b)(1)(D)]. </p>
