  <p>For qualified clients, there are tremendous benefits available from a private foundation. These benefits range from immediate income tax advantages, to the unparalleled satisfaction of knowing that you are making the world a better place. A private foundation can add structure and purpose to a donor's charitable activity, allow him to involve family and other important people in the charitable process, and give the donor permanent control over his assets. While the regulations regarding private foundations are extensive, a professionally managed private foundation will allow your client to obtain all the benefits, while avoiding the hassles. That is why more and more people are creating their own private foundations.</p>
