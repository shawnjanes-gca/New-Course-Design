  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Rules Against Self-Dealing</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Broadly  speaking, the prohibition on self-dealing [Section 4941] means that <strong><em>disqualified  persons</em></strong> [Section 4946] - generally the founder and lineal descendants  and antecedents (e.g. parents and children), and people under their employment  - may not engage in any transactions with the foundation, except to make  donations to it or, under limited circumstances, to receive fair market value  compensation for services [Section 4941(d)2].</p>
  <p>In general, a donor is never permitted to receive an improper benefit from a charity he or she supports. In the private foundation arena, these rules are spelled out in some detail. A few key rules that founders should be aware of: </p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>A disqualified person may not:</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Use the foundation's assets or its income for his or her own personal use</li>
      <li>Borrow money from the foundation</li>
      <li>Buy things from the foundation or sell things to it</li>
      <li>Keep foundation assets (e.g. paintings) on his or her premises</li>
    </ul>

  
  </div>
  <p>A disqualified person is permitted to have certain, arm's-length dealings with the foundation. For example, the founder and his/her family may receive reasonable director's fees (provided that they do not receive preferential treatment), and the donor and/or family members may be employed, provided that their compensation is reasonable for work actually performed. Specific situations may require specific legal advice.</p>
