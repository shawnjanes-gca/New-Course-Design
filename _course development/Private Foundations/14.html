  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Key Rules Regarding Private Foundations</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Although the benefits of a private foundation are compelling, and the activity of a private foundation is conceptually simple, the compliance and accounting aspects can be quite burdensome. Furthermore, the penalties for failing to comply with all the relevant requirements can be quite severe. For these reasons, professional management may be advisable. </p>
  <p>Congress recognized that private foundations have a tremendous amount of appeal to wealthy people. Because of perceived abuses of private foundations, which occurred many years ago, Congress has placed a number of restrictions and requirements on private foundations. Although the details of these are very complex, and compliance with them can be burdensome, the basics are fairly straightforward. Although all foundations must follow all the rules, in practice the real impact of the rules is simply to create paperwork. The following is a list of the most important of these requirements and restrictions.</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><span><strong>A prohibition on &quot;self-dealing&quot;</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>A prohibition on &quot;excess business holdings&quot; </strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>A prohibition on &quot;jeopardy investments&quot;</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Required annual distributions</strong></span></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Generally, these limitations do not affect the achievement of a founder's goals, provided that care is taken to ensure that none of the relevant rules are violated. The specifics of the rules are quite complex, and the following pages are intended as an outline only and should not be relied upon as legal advice. </p>
