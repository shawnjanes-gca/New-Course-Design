<blockquote>Although the benefits of a private foundation are compelling, and the activity of a private foundation is conceptually simple, the compliance and accounting aspects can be quite burdensome. Furthermore, the penalties for failing to comply with all the relevant requirements can be quite severe. For these reasons, professional management may be advisable.

Because of perceived abuses of private foundations, which occurred many years ago, Congress has placed a number of restrictions and requirements on private foundations.

Although all foundations must follow all the rules, in practice the real impact of the rules is simply to create paperwork. The following is a list of the most important of these requirements and restrictions.</p>
