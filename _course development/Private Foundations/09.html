  <h1><span class="pagetitle">When To Use Private Foundations</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Clients who have any plans at all to give money to charity now or in the future (including upon death), and who are financially qualified, should consider creating a private foundation now. Failure to do so will almost certainly waste precious charitable dollars by paying too much in taxes.</p>
  <p>In evaluating whether a foundation might be appropriate for a client is important to consider both the client's charitable goals and the financial situation.</p>
