<h2>When To Use Private Foundations</h2>
</td>

<td valign="top">
<p>Clients who have any plans at all to give money to charity now or in the future (including upon death), and who are financially qualified, should consider creating a private foundation now. Failure to do so will almost certainly waste precious charitable dollars by paying too much in taxes.</p>
<p><br /> In evaluating whether a foundation might be appropriate for a client is important to consider both the client's charitable goals and the financial situation.</p>
