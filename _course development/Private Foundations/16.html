  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Excess Business Holdings</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A set of rules addressing "excess business holdings" are designed to keep a private foundation from owning a significant stake in a family business. While the excess business holdings tests can become complex, a safe harbor generally provides that founders should not allow their foundation to own more than 2% of the family (or other closely held) business.</p>
  <p>As a practical matter, this means that a private foundation cannot be a significant owner of the founder's business. Be aware that while very small stakes in such companies or businesses are permitted, the rules are quite complex, and each case must be looked at individually.</p>
