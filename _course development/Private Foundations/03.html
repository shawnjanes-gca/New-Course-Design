    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A private foundation is classified as an Internal Revenue Code 501(c) 3 entity, which qualifies it as a tax-exempt charity funded and controlled by one or more individuals or a family. The purpose for developing these entities can be varied, but the common denominator is the desire of an individual or family to utilize a portion of their wealth to fulfill their intent to better the world relative to specific issues to which they are committed. Most foundations function as general-purpose endowment funds that the families use to make their charitable contributions.</p>
  <p>The basic activity of a private foundation is simple, consisting of four elements.  <span class="pageInstruction">Move your mouse pointer in numerical sequence to each numbered bullet to learn more.</span> </p>

&lt;p&gt;While typically from the founder of the foundation, usually donations can be made by anyone. These donations are tax deductible, with no subsequent income tax on the income earned by the foundation. There are, however, some restrictions on the types of assets that can be gifted, which will be discussed later in this course.&lt;/p&gt;">

&lt;p&gt;Private foundations are designed for longevity and therefore do not typically disburse the entirety of the assets. Any assets left in the foundation need to be invested. Investment management is typically done by professional advisors, but can be done by the directors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;There are significant tax and regulatory requirements that must be adhered to with a Private Foundation. Because these issues can be quite burdensome, many foundations outsource this administrative function to professional advisors.&lt;/p&gt;">

&lt;p&gt;In return for the significant tax benefits offered by private foundations, the foundation must make charitable distributions to public charities each year. These contributions must generally be at least 5% of the foundation's assets.&lt;/p&gt;">
