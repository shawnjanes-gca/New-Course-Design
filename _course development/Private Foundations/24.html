  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Case Study 3 - Income Tax Advantages Over Time</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Over time, the advantage of the foundation grows because private foundations are not subject to income tax. Properly managed, private foundations pay only a minimal excise tax of 2% on investment income. Let us illustrate the effect of these tax savings by expanding the previous example.</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
    <h3>Case Study 3 - Income  Tax Advantages Over Time</h3>
     <p> Suppose Mr. Johansenn is 55 years old and has assets of  $12,500,000, which return 8% a year net pre-tax, giving him $1,000,000 of  income. Also assume that each year he contributes 30% of his income to his  foundation, his foundation earns 8%, makes the required minimum annual  distribution, and pays excise taxes of 2% of investment income and foundation  management fees of 1% of assets. Assuming all income is interest income and  ignoring any living expenses and computing his taxes at a flat 45%, after 27  years his net worth will be $28.4 million, and his foundation will be worth  $16.3 million, for a total of $44.7 million.</p>
     <p> Contrast that situation to one in which the client has no  foundation but makes the same charitable contributions as his foundation would  have made. He will have $33.3 million after 27 years. Thus, during the client's  life, he can increase the assets under his control by over $11.4 million just  by funding his foundation annually.</p>
