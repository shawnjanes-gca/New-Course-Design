  <h1><span class="pagetitle">The Prevalence of Private Foundations</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Private foundations have long been the vehicle of choice by which the extremely wealthy have conducted their charitable activities. Among the best known, and largest, private foundations are the Ford Foundation, the Getty Trust, and the Rockefeller Foundation. But there are also thousands of smaller, less well-known private foundations in existence, controlling in aggregate billions of dollars. While historically associated with the wealthiest in society, private foundations are increasingly a viable and effective alternative that should be considered by affluent clients who are seeking to "give back" to the community while taking advantage of numerous tax advantages designed to stimulate philanthropic intent.</p>
  <p>Private foundations control a great deal of philanthropic wealth, and also represent an important component of philanthropic giving each year. Although exact current statistics are not available (because of lags in IRS reporting), there are approximately 50,000 grant-making private foundations in the US, controlling approximately $300 billion in assets (this number, of course, fluctuates daily). Each year private foundations contribute about $15 billion to various public charities.</p>
