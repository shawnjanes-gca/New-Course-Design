  <h1><span class="pagetitle">RMD Reporting Requirements</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>While making the complex RMD and distribution minefield far simpler, there is a &quot;price.&quot; In exchange for simplified rules, the IRS requires IRA custodians/issuers to furnish an RMD notice to every IRA owner who must take a required minimum distribution for the year.  This notice must be provided by January 31 of the year for which the distribution is required.  Therefore, if an owner is required to take an RMD with respect to 2016, then the IRA custodian/issuer must furnish the notice by January 31, 2016.</p>
  <p>In providing this notice, the IRA custodian/issuer has the option of calculating and providing the RMD amount or offering to calculate and provide it if requested.  Many custodians/issuers are opting to provide a safe harbor calculation of the RMD amount and do not take into account any individual situations (e.g., a spouse who is ten years younger).  Therefore, individuals should work with their tax advisors to determine if adjustments should be made.  Additionally, IRA custodians/issuers must annually notify the IRS when an RMD is required for an IRA.  This allows the IRS to accurately identify anyone not in compliance.</p>
