<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In order to limit the time that an IRA can maintain tax-deferred status, the IRS has enacted rules that require the IRA owner to begin making distributions from an IRA upon attaining age 70&frac12;. These rules are tools of the IRS to ensure that the IRA is used for the primary purpose of retirement planning for the owner and his or her spouse. The rules force the IRA owner to take a minimum distribution, known as the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD), from the IRA on an annual basis, with the amount calculated on the basis of life expectancy.</p>
<p>Note that even if the owner withdraws significant amounts from his/her IRA prior to reaching age 70&frac12;, he/she must begin to withdraw certain minimum amounts each and every year thereafter.</p>
<p>This course focuses on understanding the rules that determine when these RMDs must begin and how they are calculated. Note that ROTH IRA accounts are not subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMD), so the guidance in this area will not extend to ROTH IRAs.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>2. Death of the IRA owner </strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The second instance when the IRA must distribute assets is upon the death of the IRA owner. Distributions to the designated beneficiary(ies) of the IRA must begin by the end of the year following the year of death of the IRA owner. The guidance in this area <strong><em>does</em></strong> extend to Roth IRAs. This is a complex subject of rules and calculations which we discuss in another course, "Planning for After-Death IRA Distributions."</p>
