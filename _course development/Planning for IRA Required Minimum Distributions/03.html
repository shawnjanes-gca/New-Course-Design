  </h1>
  <p>The Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) rules in Code Section 401 contain provisions regarding the commencement, minimum amounts, and timing of distributions from retirement plans. While there are specific characteristics of different plans that require specific rules, the Section 401 provisions generally apply to all of the following retirement plans.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <div align="center"><p><strong>Retirement Plans</strong></p></div>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Individual Retirement Arrangements      (IRAs)</li>
      <li>403(b) Plans</li>
      <li>Qualified retirement      plans, such as profit sharing, 401(k), ESOP, and stock bonus plans</li>
      <li>Simplified Employee Plans      or SEP IRAs</li>
      <li>Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees or SIMPLEs  </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>In general, the regulations apply evenly to all the plans listed and may also apply to others not listed. However, there are some subtle variations and special rules that relate to each particular plan type. For the purposes of this module and simplicity's sake, we will focus our comments on the application for owners of <strong><em>individual retirement arrangements</em></strong>.</p>
