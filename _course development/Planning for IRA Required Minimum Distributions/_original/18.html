<p>This concludes the training on IRA Required Minimum Distributions. By way of review, it is important to make sure you clearly understand the important terms and rules that have been presented. It is also important to remember that, since RMDs can be quite complicated, every client situation should be reviewed on an individual basis and clients should consult a tax advisor for any detailed questions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">For the terms below, first try to define each in your own mind, then click each term for further understanding and clarification.</span></strong></p>

<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition: </strong>It is April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the owner reaches 70&frac12; years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Significance: </strong>The owner must withdraw the initial RMD amount by this time.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition: </strong>It is the minimum amount that must be distributed each year once the owner reaches 70&frac12; years of age. It is calculated by dividing the 12/31 account value from the previous calendar year by the appropriate divisor, as derived from the appropriate life expectancy table. If it is the initial RMD, then the 12/31 account value from the year prior to turning 70&frac12; is used, independent of when the initial RMD is actually distributed.</p>
<p><strong>Significance: </strong>It forces a graduated end to the tax deferral status of IRA assets and requires some planning so as to minimize its effect and provide the owner and beneficiaries with maximum flexibility as to when and how much to withdraw.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition: </strong>It is the table used to determine the life expectancy factor for most IRA RMDs. This table assumes that the designated beneficiary is 10 years younger than the IRA owner and offers the automatic benefits of annual recalculation.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Provides simplicity in the calculation methodology, as there is one table that suffices for almost all IRA owners.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> It is the table used to determine the life expectancy factor for IRA RMDs when the IRA owner has a spouse who is designated as sole beneficiary and that spouse is more than 10 years younger than the owner.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Under the current rules, this table provides such IRA owners with extended life benefits for the IRA, since the life expectancy factor for computing RMDs is based on the actual ages of the owner and spouse beneficiary.</p>
