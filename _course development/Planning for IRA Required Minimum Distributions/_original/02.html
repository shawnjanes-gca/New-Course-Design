<p>The current RMD regulations provide drastic simplification in the calculation of the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). Under the previous rules, the calculation was based on the designated beneficiary as of a specific date and the calculation methodology that the IRA owner chose at that time. The critical changes leading to the current rules are mainly twofold.</p>

<p>While the previous rules provided for a total of 7 specific calculation choices - depending on beneficiaries and election methods - there are now only two methods that are used to calculate the RMD. Under the current rules, the IRS has combined the most advantageous aspects of the various old calculation methodologies within the new simplified calculation structure.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The restrictive nature of certain designated beneficiary selections has also been lifted. Under the current rules, the designated beneficiary decision no longer irrevocably establishes the lifespan of the IRA; and the designated beneficiary, with its associated RMD calculation, can be changed to suit the desires of the IRA owner.</p>

<p>In summary, relative to the calculation of the RMD, the current rules are very generous when compared to the previous regulations.</p>
