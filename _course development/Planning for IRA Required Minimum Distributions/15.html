  <p>There are three steps to determining the life expectancy factor for the initial RMD.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li><span>Establish the calendar      year in which the IRA owner attains 70½,</span></li>
      <li><span>Regardless of the owner&rsquo;s      age, determine the IRA owner&rsquo;s attained age as of the end of that calendar      year for which the distribution will be made.</span></li>
      <li><span>Refer to the appropriate life expectancy table.</span></li>
    </ol>
</div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>Factors for use in subsequent years are identified by determining the owner&rsquo;s attained age as of the end of the calendar year in which the distribution is made.  Since the RMD is recalculated every year and the life expectancy factor (the divisor) will always be greater than 1, the IRA will never be exhausted during the owner's lifetime if distributions are never greater than the RMD, barring negative performance of the owner's investments.</p>
  <p>Look at the following example:</p>
  <p><strong>Example: </strong>Michelle Howard celebrates her 70th birthday on February 14, 2016. When is her Required Beginning Date?</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>February 14, 2016</li>
    <li>April 1, 2016</li>
    <li>December 31,      2017</li>
    <li>April 1, 2017</li>
  </ul>
Having established the RBD, what is her life expectancy factor using the Uniform Table for the initial RMD?
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - She attains age 70½ in 2016</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Since she turned 70 in 2016, she will not have another birthday before the end of the year, so her attained age will be 70 at the first year for which she is taking a distribution (in 2016).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - From the Uniform Table, an example of which can be viewed by clicking here, select the life expectancy factor to be used for someone age 70.</p>
