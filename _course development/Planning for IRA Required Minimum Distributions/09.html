  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Calculating the RMD</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Under the rules, the RMD calculation is very simple. To determine the annual Required Minimum Distribution, the IRA account balance<sup>*</sup> is divided by the appropriate life expectancy from one of two tables. The table that is used will depend on the designated beneficiary.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="298" valign="top" align="center"><strong><u>IRA Balance as of 12/31 of previous   year</u><sup>*</sup></strong></td>
        <td width="19" rowspan="2" align="center"><strong>=</strong></td>
        <td width="128" rowspan="2" align="center"><strong>RMD for current year</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="298" valign="top" align="center"><strong>Appropriate Divisor from Life Expectancy   Table</strong></td>
      </tr>
  </table></div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>The following pages will describe how to determine these factors appropriate for each client's situation. We will begin with determining the appropriate account balance to be used.</p>
  <p>What happens to the RMD if the value of the IRA falls dramatically due to market fluctuations? Think of someone who had a majority of their IRA in tech stocks in 2002. Because the RMD for 2003 was calculated using the ending balances from 2002, the calculated RMD could well exceed the actual account balance after the stock decline. Instead of the IRA owner paying a penalty, IRS regulations specify that the owner would simply take the remainder of the balance as a final distribution and thereby avoid the penalty.</p>
