<p>Failure to make the Required Minimum Distribution will result in a 50% penalty imposed on any amount that should have been distributed and was not. This is compounded by the income tax that will be due on the entire amount as well. As you can see, the net consequence is that a majority of the amount that was due to be distributed will be eroded by income taxes and the 50% penalty.</p>
<p>Since IRA custodians must notify the IRS when RMDs are required from IRAs, the IRS will have the ability to identify and assess these severe penalties to anyone who does not make the appropriate distributions. While it is the client's responsibility to make the appropriate distribution, the client certainly will want to plan for the event and minimize any required distribution, thereby maximizing the tax-deferred advantages of the account.</p>
