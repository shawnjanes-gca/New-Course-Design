  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Determining the Account Balance</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p><strong>General Rule of Thumb</strong>: For the sake of simplicity, the account balance used for calculating the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) is the balance in the IRA as of December 31 of the year preceding the year for which the required minimum distribution is being figured.</p>
  <p>The only complication is the determination of the account balance to be used for the initial RMD, since the initial RMD may be withdrawn in either of two years.  The year-end account balance used to calculate the initial RMD (no matter when it is distributed) is the 12/31 balance from the year just prior to the year in which the IRA owner turns 70½. Thus, the rules allow the owner to postpone the initial distribution of the RMD, but not the calculation of the amount.</p>
  <p>Look at the following examples to further understand the methodology for determining the account balance and life expectancy factor for calculating RMDs.</p>

    <div align="center"><h3>About Mr. Burkhart</h3></div>
    <p>Tim Burkhart turns 70 on August 26, 2016, and 70½ on February 26, 2017, thereby making his Required Beginning Date April 1, 2018. The following details the effective dates for determining his RMD.</p>
