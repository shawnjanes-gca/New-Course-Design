  <p>The date by which Required Minimum Distributions (RMD) must begin is referred to as the <strong><em>Required Beginning Date</em></strong> (RBD). The RBD is defined as:</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2</p>
  <p>That is not to say that the initial RMD must be made on April 1. Rather, it is to say that sometime between the start of the year in which the owner turns 70Â½ and April 1 of the following year, the first RMD must be made.</p>
  <p>The following examples can clarify this definition. <span class="pageInstruction">Click the icon to view Example #1.</span></p>
