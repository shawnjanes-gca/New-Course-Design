    <p class="objective-leadin">This module is designed to provide you with a greater understanding of the rules governing Required Minimum Distributions (also called Minimum Required Distributions) from IRAs during the owner's lifetime.Â  Having laid this foundation, you will then be better equipped to further your studies regarding beneficiary designations and what happens after the death of the IRA owner.</p>
    <p class="objective-leadin">Completing this module will further your understanding of:</p>
    <div class="objective-points">
      <p>The important terminology related to the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) calculation.</p>
      <p>The initial RMD and when it must be distributed.</p>
      <p>The methodology for calculating lifetime RMDs for clients.</p>

  <p>Why does this course matter to you and your clients? If you serve clients or advise family members who are nearing or in retirement, an understanding of Required Minimum Distributions (RMD) can:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span>Help avoid a combined <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75% Tax and Penalty Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 2em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your cousin Marie, age 71, was not well-advised and failed to take her first required minimum distribution timely. She was supposed to take a $50,000 distribution no later than April 1, but mistakenly believed she had until the end of the year. She is in a combined state/federal income tax bracket of 25%. Here is how the penalty and income tax will impact her:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;$50,000 = Required Distribution on April 1&lt;br&gt;-12,500 = &lt;strong&gt;25%&lt;/strong&gt; combined state/federal income tax &lt;br&gt;-&lt;u&gt;25,000&lt;/u&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;50%&lt;/strong&gt; penalty on required distribution not taken timely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$12,500 = Net cash received from a late $50,000 distribution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">75% tax and penalty rate</a></span></li>
    <li><span>Demonstrate the effective use of beneficiary designations</span></li>
    <li><span>Show how to avoid certain 10% penalties from inherited IRAs</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Competency in this area requires a strong knowledge of the basic regulations. At the core, the RMD regulations provide client and advisors alike with:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> in the calculation of the <a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_2" class="p7TTM_trg" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon reaching a specified age, minimum distributions are required each year.&lt;/p&gt;">Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)</a></li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> for      the IRA owner and the designated beneficiaries of the IRA </li>
