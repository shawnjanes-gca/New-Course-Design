  <p>Generally, the RMD is based on the IRA balance as of December 31 of the previous calendar year, (unless adjustments are required for any pending rollovers or transfers, which we will not cover in this course). The selected 12/31 balance is divided by the appropriate divisor based on the appropriate life expectancy table. Under the current rules for lifetime RMDs, there are only two life expectancy tables that are used to determine the RMD.</p>
  <p><strong>Option #1 </strong>- The spouse is the sole beneficiary and is more than 10 years younger than the IRA owner. <br>
  <strong>Option #2 </strong>- Everyone else. </p>

    <p>(Note that there is a third table that is used in calculations of the RMDs for some IRA beneficiaries who inherit IRA balances. The above only refer to lifetime RMD calculations.)</p>

<p>Keep in mind that these are Required MINIMUM Distribution calculations. An owner can always withdraw more than the minimum.</p>
