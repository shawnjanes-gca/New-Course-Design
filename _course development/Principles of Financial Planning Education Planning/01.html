  <p>One of the more significant financial liabilities facing individuals with children is saving for college. Nearly every parent, and in some cases grandparents, cite saving for college as a major financial goal – and rightfully so. Recent studies show that in-state tuition, fees, housing, and meals at public universities average $19,548* per year. Worse still are the figures for private education, with average tuition and fees of $43,921* per year. And these costs do not include room and board. It’s a wonder that doctors do not greet new parents with, “Congratulations, you’ve just given birth to a beautiful baby and a $100,000 education liability!”</p>
  <p>While many individuals have some understanding of the potential future costs of educating their children, very few understand the various savings options available to them, and fewer still have actually developed a clear and rational education savings strategy. Surveys of parents with children under age 18 reveal that only approximately one fifth of parents are aware of section 529 plans.  When these parents were made aware of section 529 plans, half to two-third said they would open an account within the next year.  Such results highlight the tremendous opportunity for financial services professionals to work with clients to help them define effective strategies for funding future education expenses.</p>
  <p>This course is specifically designed to equip you with the knowledge you need to engage clients in more effective discussions about education savings alternatives and to help them define an effective strategy for them given their unique circumstances.</p>
