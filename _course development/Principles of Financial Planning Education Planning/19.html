    <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /><strong>Who Can I Select as a Beneficiary? </strong></h3>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Answer:  </strong>The contributor can select any U.S. citizen or legal resident as the beneficiary. The beneficiary does not have to be a family member. You can even select yourself as beneficiary.  </p>

    <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /><strong>Can I Change the Beneficiary?</strong></h3>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong>  Generally, you can change the beneficiary. However, to avoid Federal income tax and the 10% penalty, the new beneficiary must be a family member of the original beneficiary. Also, for Prepaid Plans, this may require an adjustment to the premium.*</p>
  <p>Eligible family members of the original family member include:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>A son or daughter or a      descendent of either</li>
    <li>A stepson or      stepdaughter</li>
    <li>A brother, sister,      stepbrother or stepsister</li>
    <li>A father or mother or      an ancestor of either</li>
    <li>A stepfather or      stepmother</li>
    <li>A brother or sister of      the father or mother</li>
    <li>A son or daughter of a      brother or sister</li>
    <li>A son-in-law,      daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or      sister-in-law</li>
    <li>The spouse of the      beneficiary or the spouse of any individual described above</li>
    <li>A first cousin of the beneficiary</li>
  </ul>
  <p>* Note that the tax benefits provided to 529 Plans under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 were scheduled to "sunset" effective 12/31/2010, but the Pension Protection Act of 2006 provided that the tax-free treatment for qualified withdrawals from 529 Plans has now been made permanent.</p>

    <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /><strong>What Happens if the Beneficiary Receives a Scholarship?</strong></h3>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong>  The account owner can withdraw assets commensurate with the value of the scholarship. The withdrawal is subject to Federal income taxes but will not be charged the 10% Federal tax penalty subject to non-qualified withdrawals.</p>

    <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /><strong>What Happens if the Beneficiary Becomes Disabled or Dies? </strong></h3>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong>  The account owner can withdraw the funds. The withdrawal is subject to Federal income tax but will not be charged the 10% Federal tax penalty levied on non-qualified withdrawals.</p>

    <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /><strong>What Happens if My Beneficiary Decides Not to Go to College? </strong></h3>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The account owner can change beneficiaries subject to the rules stated above or simply withdraw the funds and pay the Federal tax and 10% penalty on earnings.</p>

    <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /><strong>What Happens with a Prepaid Plan if the Beneficiary goes to a Private or Out-of-State School? </strong></h3>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>In that case, the funds can be applied to the private or out-of-state school, but the amount would have nothing to do with the actual costs of the private or out-of-state school. Instead, the funds available would be equal to the average cost of attending an in-state public school.</p>

  </div>
