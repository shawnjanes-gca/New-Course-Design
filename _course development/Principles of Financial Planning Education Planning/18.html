The following is a Reference Guide of some of the common questions that clients may pose. It is important that you cross-reference this information with any laws specific to your state and the specific guidelines of the Plan(s) you are offering.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer: </strong> Any U.S. citizen or legal U.S. resident can set up a 529 Plan account. Minors can establish an account; however, a parent or guardian must sign the account application.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong>  Certain Prepaid Plans are guaranteed by the sponsoring state. You must refer to the individual state's plan to make that determination. Savings Plans, on the other hand, are never guaranteed.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Although contribution limits vary by Plan and by state, the maximum contribution to any Plan in most states exceeds $300,000 per beneficiary. In some cases, when the value of the account reaches the plan's maximum limit, either through contributions and/or growth, no more contributions can be made to that account. But again, limits will vary by state, and should always be verified.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Qualified expenses include tuition, books, fees, room and board, supplies and equipment for enrollment (must be enrolled on at least a half-term basis) and certain special need expenses at an Eligible Educational Institution as defined by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Most colleges, universities, community colleges, vocational schools, and even some foreign institutions qualify.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer: </strong>A successor owner is typically selected upon opening of the account. If no succession is defined, in most states the estate of the deceased owner becomes the owner of the account.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The account is not included as part of the owner's estate. If, however, the owner dies within five (5) years of taking advantage of the special annual gift tax exclusion made to accelerate gifts to the beneficiary, the portion of the gift(s) allocated to the years after the account owner's death will be included in the account owner's estate.  When calculating recapture, keep in mind that the annual gift tax exclusion amount was $13,000 from 2009-2012, and $14,000 from 2013-2016.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, rollovers can be made from one 529 Savings Plan to another once every 12 months or whenever a beneficiary change is made.</p>
