<h2>529 Savings Plans: For Those Who Want Greater Investment Flexibility</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The greatest growth is taking place with Savings Plans. The 529 Savings Plan has a very simple concept behind it. An individual makes contributions to a 529 Plan account that grows tax deferred and must then choose from among the predefined investment options offered by that plan. Generally, the available investment options range from conservative to aggressive, and offer pre-determined investment mix options that will vary depending on the age of the prospective student. This last option, the pre-determined investment mix, will tend to be very aggressive for young prospective students and become increasingly conservative as they near college age. Regardless of the investment option chosen, when the beneficiary starts college, assets in the account can be withdrawn federally tax free to pay for "qualified" education expenses (tuition, books, fees, room and board). Depending on the state, state taxes may or may not be due.*</p>
<p>To contrast Savings Plans to Prepaid Plans, let's again use the example of the Smiths.</p>

<p>Jack and Lauren Smith decide to begin saving for their newborn son Michael's college education. They choose to open a 529 Savings Plan, making monthly payments of $250 ($3,000 per year). From the five investment options provided, they choose the Aggressive Option that has a mix of 90% Large Cap Stocks and 10% Intermediate Term Bonds. Given historical returns, they can expect to earn about 8% on their contributions, bringing the total in 18 years to $120,000. That is considerably more than their 18-year contribution of $54,000.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> They have assumed market risk with this Plan. While they might end up with $150,000 or even more for their child's education, they could also suffer poor investment performance. For example, if they averaged an annual return of 4%, the ending balance would be $79,000. Other factors may also affect the investment return of a 529 Savings Plan, such as sales charges, fees, and expenses that vary depending upon specific plans.</p>

<p>Thus, while the ultimate objective of the Prepaid Tuition Plan and the Savings Plan is the same - to allow for the accumulation of assets that will be used in the future to pay for college expenses - the approach in each plan is quite different. As you can see from the examples given, a Prepaid Plan is a contract between the state and the contributor to pay for college expenses as stipulated by the plan. Alternatively, a Savings Plan enables the contributor greater flexibility in the amount of contributions and choice among investment options. But with Savings Plans, there is no guarantee that the assets in the Plan will be enough to cover Qualified Expenses; the assets could be more or less than what is needed, dependent upon contributions, investment opportunities, and cost of the educational institution selected.</p>
