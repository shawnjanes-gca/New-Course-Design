<h2>Basic Rules Governing 529 Plans</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>To understand how these Plans work, it is best to start with the Internal Revenue Code itself. Prior to the adoption of Section 529 in the Code in 1996, similar plans had already been created. The code section was adopted to provide the official IRS rules by which such plans are created and governed. The seven basic rules under Section 529 are listed below:</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>A plan must be established and maintained by a state or state agency, or eligible educational institution (prepaid-plans only). State programs can be either prepaid or savings plans; private educational institutions can only offer prepaid plans.</p>
</div>

<div class="p7ABtrig">

<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This prevents individuals from avoiding the payment of capital gains taxes by contributing appreciated assets. However, note that some states permit the direct rollover of assets from one 529 Plan to another 529 Plan. A direct rollover is a transaction in which assets are transferred directly from the old 529 Plan to the new 529 Plan.</p>
<p>All other transfers to a 529 Plan must generally be made in cash.&nbsp; Assets held in UGMA/UTMA accounts, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, or certain U.S. Savings Bonds issued after 1989 must be distributed in cash and then deposited within 60 days into the 529 Plan.&nbsp; The use of UGMA/UTMA funds for 529 Plan contributions is either restricted or forbidden in many states.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Contributors are not allowed to individually direct the investment of any contribution, but so far this requirement seems to have been interpreted rather loosely. While contributors have not been allowed to choose from among individual stocks and bonds or from among unlimited numbers of mutual funds, Plans are allowing contributors to allocate balances among a group of investment options established by the Plan.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The Program must establish separate accounting for each participant. This applies to both Prepaid Tuition and Savings Plans. However, in the Prepaid Tuition plans, the separate account is basically maintained to track dollars paid for contracts.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_6">
<div id="p7ABc1_6" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>There must be reasonable limits on contributions to the Program. This has been interpreted as allowing contributions in the amount of projected future education costs. The proposed regulations set a safe harbor limit equal to the amount determined to be actuarially necessary to pay tuition, required fees and room and board expenses of the beneficiary for five years of undergraduate school at the most expensive institution allowed by the program.</p>
<p>Since the cost of the highest price institution varies by state, each state will set its own limits. Some states permit contributions until the account balance reaches well over $300,000. If the accumulation limit is reached, no more contributions can be made.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_7" href="javascript:;"><strong>7. Penalties and Restrictions For "Non-Qualified" Withdrawals</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_7">
<div id="p7ABc1_7" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>A non-qualified withdrawal is one that is not used to pay for tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and room and board at an eligible educational institution. Non-qualified withdrawals are subject to both tax on the earnings and a tax penalty on the earnings portion of the amounts withdrawn. Earnings are also subject to income taxation.</p>
<p>Prior to 2001, the requirement was that the penalty had to be for more than a "<em><strong>de minimis</strong></em>" amount. <em>De minimis</em> was interpreted to be at least 10%. The amendment to this requirement enacted in 2001 changed the penalty on earnings from a<em>de minimis</em> amount to a Federal 10% additional tax on the earnings portions of non-qualified withdrawals.</p>
<p>Payments made as a result of the death or disability of a beneficiary or as a result of the receipt of a scholarship are exempt from this additional tax.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_8">
<div id="p7ABc1_8" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In most cases, 529 plans are no longer restricted by state lines. That means you could live in Florida, invest in a state plan in Wisconsin, and send your student to college in Nevada.</p>
<p>Some plans still have restrictions, though, so it's always a good idea to check the guidelines for each plan.</p>
