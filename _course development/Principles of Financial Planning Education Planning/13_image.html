  </h1>
  <p>A Prepaid Tuition Plan is one in which a contract is purchased for a <strong><em>specific price</em></strong>. This contract may provide a <strong><em>guarantee</em></strong> to pay tuition and fees at an accredited in-state public college or university, as stipulated by the Plan.  If the student attends a private college or university, or attends an out-of-state public college or university, the plans <strong>typically</strong> pay the average of in-state public college tuition.  The family will be responsible for the difference, if any.</p>
  <!-- Insert image to the right. -->
  <p>The price of the contract is based upon a number of factors, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The current cost of in-state public college tuition and fees.</li>
    <li>The age of the prospective student.</li>
    <li>The number of years of education to be purchased.</li>
    <li>The time period over which the contract will be paid (for example: lump sum versus 10 year installments).</li>
    <li>Actuarial assumptions regarding how much tuition and fees will increase in the future and the future return on investments. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The contract defines the specific education expenses that will be covered for the specified student. When the student begins school, the contract will pay the expenses at the level required at that time.</p>

    <p><strong>The Smiths</strong></p>
    <p>Jack and Lauren Smith have a four-month-old baby, Michael. In-state tuition and fees are currently $5,000 per year. They want to be assured that Michael will be financially able to attend college, so they have chosen to participate in the State Prepaid Plan. The following are the stipulations of the Plan:</p>
    <table id="tableAlignLeft">
   
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Child&rsquo;s current age:</th>
        <td>4 months</td>
 
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Lump Sum Contribution Price:</th>
        <td>$20,000</td>
       
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Benefit:</th>
        <td>4 years tuition and fees at one of the accredited state universities</td>
       
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In 18 years, when Michael is ready to attend college, tuition and fees are projected to grow 7 to 8% per year, giving rise to an expected future cost as high as $80,000. Regardless of the actual future cost, the Prepaid Plan will pay the tuition and fees for him for the four years stipulated in the Plan.</p>
  </div>
  <p><strong></strong></p>
  <p>It is important to understand that a Prepaid Plan is designed to pay in-state public tuition and fees that are in effect at the time the child goes to college, not a specified dollar amount. In the above example, if the tuition and fees rise to $20,000 per year by the time the child goes to college, then $20,000 will be paid. Likewise, if tuition and fees only rise to $10,000 per year, then $10,000 will be paid. </p>
