<h2>Considerations for the Trustee</h2>

<p>Most fiduciary institutions have established policies and procedures regarding the acceptance and administration of trusts. Many will have policies and procedures that are specific to Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts. The following considerations are in no way exhaustive, nor should they be considered legal advice regarding the administration of Crummey Trusts. But they are considerations that are frequently incorporated into operating procedures.</p>

<div id="p7ABW1" class="p7AB">
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_1" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>The trust should make the insurance application</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>If a new policy is to be purchased, the trust should make the application rather than the grantor. This preserves the independence of the trust in making the decision to invest in insurance rather than in other assets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Change ownership and beneficiary designations of pre-existing policies</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Failure to make sure that the ownership and beneficiary designation of a transferred policy are changed to the trust could have major repercussions. In at least one actual case, the beneficiary designation was changed but the ownership was not. This resulted in the proceeds being paid to the trust, but the policy was still includable in the grantor's estate. To further complicate the situation, there was a surviving spouse who could have received the assets, at least making it possible to defer taxation on the policy. But since the assets were paid to the trust, no marital deduction was available and the estate had to pay estate taxes on the life insurance policy proceeds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Grantor should never pay premiums</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The IRS could potentially use the payment of premiums by the grantor as an incident of ownership.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_4" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Notice of contributions should be in writing</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>There is no predetermined format for notices to beneficiaries, but such notices should inform the beneficiaries of the contribution and their right to withdraw. These notices should be in writing; hence they are normally referred to as "Crummey Letters." It is also a good idea to have the beneficiaries provide signed acknowledgement of receipt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_5" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Notice should be given immediately upon each contribution</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Again, there is no specific guideline, but in one IRS private letter ruling the IRS gave indication that notices should be sent out within 14 days of contribution. There are also other indications by the IRS that such notices should be done <em><strong>each time</strong></em> a contribution is made and that beneficiaries cannot waive their right to future notices.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_6" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Observe the prudent investor rule</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_6">
<div id="p7ABc1_6" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Remember that the trustee is bound by the prudent investor rule, which requires the trustee to make trust investments in a prudent manner. The trustee is responsible for both the selection and purchase of the policy, as well as for the ongoing investment management of the policy. Is the policy competitively priced? Is the insurance company financially sound? These are the types of questions to be asked when deciding to make the purchase. On a periodic basis the trustee should examine whether or not the policy is performing competitively.</p>
