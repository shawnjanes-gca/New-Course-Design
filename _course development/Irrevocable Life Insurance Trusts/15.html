    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Since the IRS is not particularly enamored with Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts, a slip up in structuring and administering an ILIT can cause the insurance proceeds to be included in the estate. This could not only frustrate the objectives of the grantor, but could cause considerable liability exposure to the trustee as well.</p>
  <p>A qualified attorney should draft the trust. The following considerations are positions that have been frequently expressed by attorneys practicing in the field. In no way should this list be taken as legal advice. However, familiarity with these considerations should assist in reviewing the document and intelligently discussing its terms.</p>

              <p>Incidents of ownership include the power to change beneficiaries, to cash in the policy, and to borrow against the policy.  Generally speaking, the power to cancel a policy would constitute an incident of ownership. While the grantor would no longer be able to contact the insurance company and cancel the policy once it is placed in the ILIT, he or she could effectively cause the policy to lapse by failing to make contributions that could be used to pay premiums. But the grantor is never under any obligation to make contributions to the trust, and the failure to do so does not constitute an incident of ownership.</p>

              <p>If a beneficiary is given a present interest in the gift to the trust, and decides to leave it in the trust, doesn't the act of leaving it in the trust (i.e., allowing the power over the asset to lapse) constitute a gift to the trust from the beneficiary? The answer is that it could possibly result in a taxable transfer by the beneficiary. To avoid this possibility, the attorney might take one or more of the following steps:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Limit the Crummey power to      the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the trust.       This is known as a &quot;<em>5 x      5 power</em>.&quot; The reason for this is that when you have the power to      remove an asset from a trust but you allow it to lapse, it is only      considered a taxable transfer by the power holder to the extent that the      asset exceeds $5,000 or 5% of the trust.       Thus, by limiting the power to this amount, you avoid the      possibility of the beneficiary making a taxable gift. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>If the beneficiary's      interest in the contribution exceeds that amount, then give the      beneficiary the right to direct the disposition of the excess in his/her      will. This retained power will cause the excess to be included in the      beneficiary&rsquo;s estate rather than be considered a gift. </li>
                <li>Alternatively, provide what is known as a &quot;<em>hanging</em>&quot; Crummey power that lapses in stages. A hanging power is one that, if not fully used in one year, carries over to the next year. By making the 5 x 5 power a &quot;hanging&quot; power, any amount greater than $5,000 or 5% of the trust would carry over to the next year. This would be repeated until there were no excess amounts to carry forward.   </li>
              </ul>
