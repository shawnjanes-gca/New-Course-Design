<p>For a gift to qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion, the IRS requires that the gift must be of a <em><strong>"present interest."</strong></em> In other words, the person receiving the gift must enjoy an immediate benefit and the unrestricted right to use, possess and enjoy the property. Generally, no annual exclusion will be granted for a<strong><em>"future interest"</em></strong> where the right to use and enjoy the property does not take place until some future time, although there are exceptions for certain trusts that are for the benefit of minor children. Nor will it be granted for an interest that is <em><strong>"contingent"</strong></em> upon the occurrence of an event or subject to the discretion of another person.</p>
<p>But most beneficiaries of irrevocable trusts do not have a present interest in the trust assets. They might have a current income interest, but they typically have no right to the assets of the trust until some future event or subject to the discretion of a trustee. In fact, the objective of an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust is precisely to leave the insurance policy in the trust until the death of the grantor/insured, at which time the beneficiaries can begin receiving benefits from the trust.</p>
<p>That is a real "catch 22." We only want the beneficiaries to have a future interest in the trust, but we must give them a present interest in order to utilize the annual gift tax exclusion. How can we do both things?</p>
