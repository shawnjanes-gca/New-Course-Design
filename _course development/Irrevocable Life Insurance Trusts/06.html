<p>Trust agreements can be extremely flexible documents and can be drafted to meet a wide variety of goals. For example, it might provide income for the surviving spouse, with the remainder to the children upon the surviving spouse's death. It might provide liquidity with which to offset the impact of estate taxes. Or it might prevent the beneficiaries from receiving the insurance proceeds prior to a specific age. Thus, the grantor (the creator of the trust), who cannot make changes to the trust agreement after it has been executed, has dictated the ultimate purpose and use of the trust assets.</p>

<p>The trust is a unique tax entity, distinct from both the insured and the trustee. If the trustee dies, the policy is not part of the trustee's estate and, therefore, has no adverse impact upon the trustee's estate.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>There are many choices regarding the selection of a trustee. The trust creator may select any responsible individual or group of individuals to act as trustee or co-trustee, or may select a corporate trustee. Because a trustee is bound to adhere to the administrative terms contained in the trust agreement, the trust creator is relying on the law, not on individual judgment. Furthermore, the trust creator can predetermine successor trustees in anticipation of the death of an individual trustee.</p>
<p>Corporate trustees bring the advantages of experience and expertise. They also bring the advantage that, unlike an individual trustee, a corporate trustee does not die. However, corporate trustees are generally going to charge for their services, whereas an individual trustee (particularly a relative) may not.</p>
