  <p>Life Insurance is typically purchased in an effort to transfer risk.Â  For example, insurance can be purchased to transfer the risk associated with a premature death and provide for the surviving family. It can also be used to provide liquidity upon death so that assets will not have to be sold to pay for estate taxes. This need for liquidity is particularly acute when the major asset of an estate is an illiquid asset such as an operating business or real estate.</p>
  <p>However, the use of life insurance in estate planning presents something of a dilemma for the estate planner because the insurance proceeds are themselves included in the estate and therefore subject to estate tax. This can be problematic with large estates. Thus, it is often desirable to arrange the use of life insurance so that it will NOT be includable in the insured's estate. This material explores techniques for achieving precisely that goal.</p>
