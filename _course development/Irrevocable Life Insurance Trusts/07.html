  <p>Generally speaking, there are two types of ILITs when referring to the assets owned by the trust. </p>

              <p>In this scenario, the trust is funded with the insurance policy <strong>and</strong> additional assets, which can be used to pay premiums. This arrangement is used infrequently because of the possible gift tax consequences of contributing the additional assets to the trust.  Often, the additional assets will exceed the annual exclusion amount (if available), resulting in the use of the applicable gift tax credit amount or perhaps even a cash payment for taxes.</p>

              <p>Actually, this name is a misnomer because the trust <strong>is</strong> funded with the life insurance policy. But it is not funded with any other assets. Each year, the grantor must make annual contributions to the trust to provide the funds needed to pay the premiums. This is customarily the way an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust is structured because it typically keeps the annual contributions within the annual exclusion amount (if available).</p>

<p>In either case, funding the trust requires a transfer of assets, which can potentially trigger a transfer tax.</p>
  <p>Thus far, we have seen that, in certain circumstances, a client can make tax-free annual exclusion gifts to the policy owner to provide funds for payment of insurance premiums, while keeping the policy out of the client&rsquo;s estate.  However, a gift to an irrevocable trust, unto itself, quite often does not qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion!</p>
  <p>Obviously, this presents a serious issue to the planner. If we cannot use the annual gift tax exclusion, then both the initial and future contributions (which are used to make premium payments) would be taxable gifts that would use up some of the tax credit (applicable credit amount) we previously discussed.</p>
  <p>Why can't the gift tax exclusion be used with irrevocable trusts? Is there an exception? Fortunately, there is a solution. However, before continuing, let's review the material already covered.</p>
