<h2>Considerations in Structuring the Trust</h2>
</blockquote>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the IRS is not particularly enamored with irrevocable life insurance trusts, a slip up in structuring and administering an ILIT can cause the insurance proceeds to be included in the estate. This could not only frustrate the objectives of the grantor, but could cause considerable liability exposure to the trustee as well.</p>
<p>A qualified attorney should draft the trust. The following considerations are positions that have been frequently expressed by attorneys practicing in the field. In no way should this list be taken as legal advice. However, familiarity with these considerations should assist in reviewing the document and intelligently discussing its terms.</p>

<p>Doing so might make it possible to argue that the title is an indication that the sole purpose of the trust was to avoid estate taxes and that there was an agreement by all parties to work together to accomplish precisely that goal.</p>

<p>For reasons similar to the preceding consideration, insurance should simply be one of the permissible investments in which the trustee can invest. The choice to purchase insurance should be one that the trustee can freely make.</p>

<p><strong>3. Grantor (the insured) cannot be trustee</strong></p>
</td>

<p>The grantor cannot also be the trustee because of the control that would be retained over the policy. Furthermore, to avoid any claim that the grantor maintained indirect control over the policy, it is also generally advisable that the spouse not be trustee.</p>

<p><strong>4. Grantor (the insured) must have "no incidents of ownership"</strong></p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Incidents of ownership include the power to change beneficiaries, to cash in the policy, and to borrow against the policy. Generally speaking, the power to cancel a policy would constitute an incident of ownership. While the grantor would no longer be able to contact the insurance company and cancel the policy once it is placed in the ILIT, he or she could effectively cause the policy to lapse by failing to make contributions that could be used to pay premiums. But the grantor is never under any obligation to make contributions to the trust, and the failure to do so does not constitute an incident of ownership.</p>

<p><strong>5. Trustee cannot be compelled to pay estate taxes</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Generally speaking, the trustee of an ILIT cannot be compelled to pay the estate taxes of the ILIT grantor. However, the trustee is frequently given the discretionary power to pay estate taxes, although the amount used to pay estate taxes would be includable in the insured's estate. An option is also frequently included in the trust agreement that allows the trustee to use the insurance proceeds to purchase assets from the estate or make a loan to the estate, thereby providing liquidity to the estate without increasing the estate tax bill.</p>

<p><strong>6. Crummey powers should exist for 30 days or more</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>For the annual gift tax exclusion to apply, the trust must contain language that creates Crummey powers. But the IRS has never dictated a specific time period that must exist before those powers lapse. Yet the IRS has approved time periods as short as 30 days, therefore 30 days has become the most common time period used in such trusts.</p>

<p><strong>7. Multiple Crummey beneficiaries permissible</strong></p>
</td>

<tr>

<p>Generally speaking, the attorney will probably exercise caution in giving a Crummey power to someone whose interest is otherwise tangential to the trust. For example, the IRS may consider the Crummey power to be ineffective if given to someone who has no rights to the trust beyond the Crummey power itself.</p>

<p>There should be no pre-arranged understanding on the part of the beneficiaries that they will not exercise their withdrawal power.

</td>

<p>While it is technically possible to give the spouse a Crummey power, this is generally not desirable because it could cause a portion of the trust to be included in the spouse's estate if non-exercise of a withdrawal right is treated a deemed transfer from the spouse to the trust.</p>

<p><strong>12. Avoid triggering a gift by the beneficiaries</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>If a beneficiary is given a present interest in the gift to the trust, and decides to leave it in the trust, doesn't the act of leaving it in the trust (i.e., allowing the power over the asset to lapse) constitute a gift to the trust from the beneficiary? The answer is that it could possibly result in a taxable transfer by the beneficiary. To avoid this possibility, the attorney might take one or more of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Limit the Crummey power to the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the trust. This is known as a "5 x 5 power." The reason for this is that when you have the power to remove an asset from a trust but you allow it to lapse, it is only considered a taxable transfer by the power holder to the extent that the asset exceeds $5,000 or 5% of the trust. Thus, by limiting the power to this amount, you avoid the possibility of the beneficiary making a taxable gift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the beneficiary's interest in the contribution exceeds that amount, then give the beneficiary the right to direct the disposition of the excess in his/her will. This retained power will cause the excess to be included in the beneficiary's estate rather than be considered a gift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, provide what is known as a "<em>hanging</em>" Crummey power that lapses in stages. A hanging power is one that, if not fully used in one year, carries over to the next year. By making the 5 x 5 power a "hanging" power, any amount greater than $5,000 or 5% of the trust would carry over to the next year. This would be repeated until there were no excess amounts to carry forward.</p>
