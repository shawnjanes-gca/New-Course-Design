<p>This was precisely the situation that was faced by a couple with the last name of Crummey. They desired to make gifts into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of their children. To create a present interest, they stipulated in the trust that the children would have the right to withdraw gifts made to the trust for a limited period of time. This, their attorney contended, created a "present interest." At the end of that time, if the funds were not withdrawn, the children's power to withdraw the property would lapse and the contributions would be governed thereafter according to the terms of the trust.</p>
<p>The IRS challenged this in court and lost the case. Henceforth, such temporary powers that are designed to generate a present interest have been termed <strong>"Crummey powers,"</strong> after the case that established the precedent.</p>
<p>Crummey powers make it possible to apply the annual gift tax exclusion to transfers to an irrevocable trust. This allows the grantor to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make annual tax-free gifts to fund payment of the premiums of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine (upon creation of the trust) how the assets are to ultimately be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate the value of the insurance policy from his taxable estate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
