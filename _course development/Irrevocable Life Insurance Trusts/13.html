<p>As the preceding example illustrates, this can be a very powerful technique for saving estate taxes. So much so that some people have become quite aggressive in their application of Crummey powers. Creative attempts have been made to maximize the annual gift tax exclusion by providing Crummey powers to as many people as necessary to cover the gift, even naming a non-related person who had no interest at all in the trust other than the temporary Crummey powers.</p>
<p>The IRS has been fairly aggressive in challenging situations that it considered shams, where excessive measures were being taken to transfer large amounts. In one case, the IRS even argued that the mere fact that assets are not withdrawn constitutes evidence that the donor's <em>intent</em> was for the beneficiaries to not remove the gift and that a prior arrangement had been made to prohibit the beneficiaries from making such withdrawals. So far the courts have not been willing to look at the intent of the donor in establishing the trust, nor have they been willing to infer a prior arrangement simply because the beneficiaries did not exercise the Crummey powers, as long as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There was an immediate and unfettered present interest for the beneficiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no evidence (beyond the beneficiaries' failure to exercise the Crummey powers) of a prearranged understanding with the beneficiaries to not exercise the Crummey powers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary point to remember is that you should proceed with caution in using Crummey powers. The IRS may be quick to act against actions that it believes are overstretching or mere shams. If a client desires to transfer a business or real estate through the use of Crummey powers, such possibilities should be explored carefully with an attorney. While the use of Crummey powers in ILITs has become fairly routine, and numerous private letter rulings have approved their use in ILITs, numerous precedents have been established that should be observed by both the attorney and the trustee. Essentially, these are safeguards to make sure that no actions on the part of the grantor or the trustee give the appearance of a sham.</p>
