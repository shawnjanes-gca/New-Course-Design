By making such an assignment, the transferor will forever surrender all the rights of ownership regarding the policy and retain no incidents of ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the value of the policy may exceed the annual gift tax exclusion amount that was discussed on the prior page. The value, which is its “interpolated terminal reserve,” is approximately its “cash value.” If the value exceeds the annual gift tax exclusion amount, then the transferor will have to file a gift tax return. This does not necessarily result in payment of a gift tax because people are given a tax credit (“applicable credit amount”) that protects a sizeable amount of lifetime or at-death transfers from having to pay the tax (i.e., the credit offsets the tax that would otherwise be due). However, it would diminish the ability to use the credit to offset the tax on subsequent lifetime or at-death transfers. But that may be a small price to pay for the benefit of removing the policy from the estate.&lt;/p&gt;

If the IRS freely allowed such transfers, it would quickly become common practice for people to make deathbed assignments of insurance in anticipation of their pending deaths. Therefore, the IRS imposes a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;three-year rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on the transfer of insurance policies, directing that any insurance policy that is transferred by the owner within three years of death (plus any gift taxes paid on the transfer) will be brought back into the transferor's taxable estate.&lt;/p&gt;"  >
