<p>Ownership of life insurance by a trust is achieved by either having the trust purchase the policy or absolutely assigning the policy to the trust (gifting). Obviously, it is preferable to have the trust purchase a new policy since this avoids the <strong><em>three-year rule</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The trust MUST be irrevocable. An <strong><em>irrevocable</em></strong> trust cannot be altered once it is established. This helps avoid incidents of ownership. If the trust were not irrevocable, the policy can be includable in the insured's estate. For similar reasons, it is best that the insured is not a trustee. It is also advisable that the insured's spouse not be a trustee.</p>
<p>Though there are many types of irrevocable trusts, when an irrevocable trust agreement contains provisions specific to the administration of life insurance policies, the trust is known as an<strong><em> Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)</em></strong>. Trusts that are designed to own life insurance are often referred to as <strong><em>Wealth Replacement Trusts</em></strong> or <strong><em>Asset Replacement Trusts</em></strong> as well. This is because they can be used to replace some of the wealth or assets that are eroded by estate taxes or perhaps by charitable gifts. Keep in mind, however, that because estate tax laws are changing, flexibility is paramount in planning. The client should carefully review any and all decisions (especially those that are irrevocable, such as an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust) with his or her attorney or tax advisor.</p>
<p>Do not confuse an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust with a "Revocable Life Insurance Trust." In a <strong><em>Revocable Life Insurance Trust</em></strong>, the grantor remains the owner of the policy, and the trust is merely the beneficiary. Such trusts are created to give the owner of the policy greater flexibility in directing the use of insurance proceeds upon death than could normally be provided for by the insurance policy's beneficiary designation. While it would be possible to create a trust by having the proceeds paid to the owner's estate, and establishing a trust under the will, a Revocable Life Insurance Trust avoids the cost and time delays involved with probate. The revocable trust can also provide a degree of privacy. However, unto itself, the revocable trust does nothing to avoid estate taxes, as the policy would still be includable in the owner's estate.</p>
