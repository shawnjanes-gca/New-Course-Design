  <p>The value of a life insurance policy can appreciate dramatically upon death. Since life insurance benefits are included in the owner's taxable estate, it is no wonder that it is one of the first assets planners seek to exclude from estate taxation. But what must be done to exclude life insurance from one's estate?</p>
  <p>The answer is simple: <strong>Don't own it or have any interest in it!</strong> Generally speaking, if you never owned the policy and the proceeds are not payable to your estate, then it is not considered a part of your estate.Â  For example, if an adult child makes the application for a new policy insuring a parent&rsquo;s life, is the designated owner, pays the premiums, and receives the proceeds, then it should not be included in the parent&rsquo;s estate.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that the parent can make a gift each year to the adult child who could, in turn, use the gift to pay the premiums. In 2016, as long as the annual gifts to the adult child are $14,000 or less ($28,000 for joint gifts by husband and wife), there would be no gift tax consequence, as gifts up to this amount (per donee) qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion. Additionally, as long as the insured does not have any of the rights associated with ownership of the policy, it should never be a part of the insured's estate. Rights typically referred to as<strong><em> incidents of ownership</em></strong> include the right to name the beneficiaries, the right to borrow against the policy, and the right to cash in the policy.</p>
  <p>In the event that a person already owns an existing policy on his or her own life, one option is to gift the policy to another person or entity. This can be a bit complicated, as shown on the following page.</p>
