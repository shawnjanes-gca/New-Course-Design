  <h1><span class="pagetitle">The Primary Goal of Asset Allocation</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>There is one primary goal of asset allocation within the investment planning process — <strong>achieving the investment objective with the minimum risk</strong>. Thus, asset allocation is the process of allocating assets in a portfolio among different asset types in order to achieve a mix that can be expected to produce the desired return for a given time horizon with the minimum risk. Given that every asset or asset class has a different risk/return profile, it follows that there are thousands of possible portfolio structures. The goal of asset allocation is to identify an optimal investment portfolio for a client&rsquo;s situation.</p>
  <p>It is also important to recognize that asset allocation takes place in the context of the client’s risk tolerance and time horizon. In general, a client’s risk tolerance helps to determine his/her asset allocation strategy and thus the targeted rate of return since higher return is generally associated with higher volatility. Likewise, the time horizon must be taken into consideration because, as we shall see, time is a significant factor in the long-term expected return of a portfolio.</p>
  <p>Over the past 50 years, there has been much theoretical research that has influenced the evolution of asset allocation as we know it today – the Capital Asset Pricing Model, Modern Portfolio Theory, Mean Variance Optimization, and Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis. We will look at each of these, but in the next few pages we focus our attention on the fundamentals that undergird these theories – return, risk, and time.</p>
