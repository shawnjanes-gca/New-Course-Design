  <p>One of the greatest difficulties in developing a good plan is identifying objectives. When asking many investors what their objectives are, they will tell you something like, "to save enough for my children's college education" or "to live comfortably upon retirement." While both are specific objectives, neither is specific enough to form the basis for effective planning. What must be identified is how much is required to meet the objective, what is the time horizon, what are the expected returns that can be achieved, what tax advantaged vehicles are available, and how much in annual or periodic funding can be added to the plan, etc. Without all of this specific information, no effective planning strategy can be developed.</p>

  <p>As an advisor, you can add value by quantifying specific goals in terms of assets required to fund the obligation, isolating the tax-advantaged accounts they might be able to utilize, and calculating the probability of success using Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis.</p>
  <p>Remember to always seek to understand the specific ways clients or prospects have already quantified their financial goals and obligations. Asking these simple questions can help you understand what they have done to date:</p>
  <p><strong>&emsp;How have you quantified your specific goals and future financial obligations?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&emsp;How does your current plan identify the effectiveness of your plan in meeting your goals?</strong></p>
  <p>Do not be concerned if they are unable to answer these questions effectively. Any inability to answer these questions simply increases their awareness of the need for specific plans and provides you with the opportunity to add value.</p>
