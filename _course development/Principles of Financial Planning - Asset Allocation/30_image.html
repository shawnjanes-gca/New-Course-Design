  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Correlation's Impact on Portfolio Risk</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>While such perfect inverse correlation is certainly extreme, this example helps illustrate how the correlation between two securities can have a significant impact upon their combined return, as well as the overall risk of the portfolio.</p>
  <p>Effective diversification should lower portfolio volatility. In other words, the benefit of diversification is that when one asset underperforms, another can compensate. Since assets with a high correlation tend to act in the same manner in response to external stimuli, a portfolio of highly correlated securities does little to diversify risk because assets with high correlation tend to act in the same manner in response to external stimuli. Therefore, <strong>to effectively diversify risk (lower volatility in a portfolio), the assets, or asset classes, must have a LOW degree of correlation.</strong></p>
  <p>Knowledge of how different asset classes correlate to each other is therefore a valuable aid in structuring a portfolio. To see how different indices correlate with each other, look at the chart below.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>MVO Example</h3>
    <p>The importance of inputting the correlation coefficient for every pair of assets when determining the MVO of a portfolio is illustrated in the following example:</p>
    <div class="explanation-widget-box">Suppose two stocks, ABC and XYZ, have the same expected return and the same degree of volatility. A portfolio consisting of 1000 shares of each stock might be expected to have the same return as a portfolio consisting of 2000 shares of only one of the stocks. But what would happen if both securities were perfectly inversely correlated. If one stock increases in value by $1.00, then the other decreases in value by $1.00. The end result is no return for the portfolio because of the correlation between the two securities. 
Note also that the risk or volatility associated with the portfolio is also affected. In fact, under such perfect inverse correlation, risk has essentially been eliminated. Each security has cancelled out the risk associated with the other and we are left with the certainty that the return will always be zero.
