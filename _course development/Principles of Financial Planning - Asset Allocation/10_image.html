  <p>Is there a pattern for returns on the market that tells us what we can expect in the future?</p>
  <p>This chart provides an interesting picture into the distribution of annual returns for the equity market.</p>
  <p><!-- Insert image. --></p>
  <p>It is readily evident that the stock market returns follow a <em>normal</em> distribution around the mean. View the example below:</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3>
  <p>If the average annual return on the S&P 500 for this time period was 11.5% with a standard deviation of 7%, we could expect that 68% of the time, the annual return of the index would be between 4.5% (i.e., 11.5% - 7%) and 18.5% (i.e., 11.5% + 7%). Going out one more standard deviation, 95% of the time the return would be between -2.5% and 25.5%. This pattern is very important, as it allows for the quantification of risk in terms of asset class volatility and provides the fundamental framework for asset allocation approaches that seek to diversify away risks without compromising returns.
