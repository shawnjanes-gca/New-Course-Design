  <p>Now that we have examined the principles, theories, and techniques of asset allocation, let's turn our attention to the process by which asset allocation is implemented with clients.</p>
  <p>There are two general approaches to asset allocation: Strategic and Tactical.</p>
  <p><strong>Strategic asset allocation</strong> is designed for a longer-term perspective. In this process, portfolios are not traded frequently but are simply rebalanced periodically to maintain the desired asset allocation that is most likely to reach the longer-term objectives of the client. The chart below helps describe the process of strategic asset allocation.</p>

  <p>Because strategic asset allocation is based on client objectives, it must take into consideration the time horizons associated with these objectives.</p>
  <p><span class="pageInstruction">Below are examples of client/prospect objectives and the time horizons typically associated with them:</span></p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">An investor may be saving for a new home, or education for children, the care of aging parents, or retirement.
  <br>Each of these objectives has a specific time frame associated with it, and assets need to be allocated to asset classes that provide the best risk/return relationship consistent with the time frame in question
