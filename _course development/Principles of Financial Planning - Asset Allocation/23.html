  <p>The CAPM is based on the assumption that all stocks share a common risk by virtue of their association with the market. For example, when the Fed dramatically raises interest rates, there is generally a negative impact on the stock market. An individual stock will generally suffer a decline in price just because of its association with the market. This risk, which stems from association with the market, is called <strong>systematic risk.</strong> When the general market moves, it has a “systematic” effect on all securities in the market.</p>
  <p>But there is also risk that is specific to a single security. This risk is referred to as <strong>specific</strong> or <strong>unsystematic risk.</strong></p>
  <p>In the CAPM, the beta of a stock reflects only its sensitivity to market movements (systematic risk). It does not reflect unsystematic risk. Since diversification with multiple stocks can eliminate specific risk through balancing out the vagaries of one stock with the vagaries of others, the CAPM works under the premise that capital markets do not yield a premium for risks that an investor can eliminate through diversification.</p>
