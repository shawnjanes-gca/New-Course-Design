  <p>Adjusting return for the impact of inflation is known as deriving the <strong>real rate of return.</strong> This is calculated as follows:</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">Real Return = Total Return - Inflation</div
  <p>In other words, real return takes into account the deflated growth of an investment.</p>
  <p>The graphic below shows the annualized <strong>"nominal"</strong> (before adjustment for inflation) rate of return for stocks, bonds, money market securities, and inflation for the last 25 years. It shows that stocks grew at a compound rate of 8.9%, bonds grew at a rate of 7.3%, and money market securities at 3.0%. But the <strong>"real"</strong> picture, after adjusting for inflation, is quite different.</p>
  <p>When the eroding effect of inflation is taken into account, the real return for each asset class was reduced to 6.7%, 5.0% and 0.5% respectively. These may not reduce exactly by 2.2% due to the effect of compounding.</p>
