  <p>To fully comprehend inflation risk, it is necessary to understand what inflation is and how it affects the purchasing power of money. Inflation is the rate at which the price of goods and services increases, thereby reducing the buying power of money.</p>
<div class="imageRight"><img src="greene/pfp_asset_allocation/images/Communicating_Impact_Inflation_Risk.svg" width="435" height="337" alt=""/><br><p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;">The graphic illustrates the magnitude of inflation risk.</p></div>  <p>In an inflationary environment, investing is like walking up an escalator that's going down. Climbing (or investing) increases the amount of money one can have, while inflation constantly reduces the value or the purchasing power of that money.</p>

  <p>Investors often fail to recognize the risk associated with inflation. Two paths that make them victims of inflation are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Do nothing</strong> - allowing inflation to nibble away at the value of their money.</li>
  <li><strong>Invest too conservatively</strong> - letting inflation and taxes consume much of their investment return.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>For the last 25 years ending in December 2015, the purchasing power of one dollar has declined to just fifty-seven cents. Therefore, the total return of an investment only tells part of the story; it must be measured relative to the inflation that occurred during that period of time, if the true performance is to be observed.</p>
