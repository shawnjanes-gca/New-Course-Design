  <p>Given the background in investment theory and the models that have led to today's approach to asset allocation and mean variance optimization, let's look at the practical application in today's investment planning process with your clients.</p>
  <p>In most cases, an investor will come to you with an array of current investment holdings. Your role is to identify the risk return profile of the current holdings and model a more effective or efficient alternative. While it sounds simplistic, this can be very complicated in actual practice. This is mainly due to some of the limitations of Mean Variance Optimization.</p>

              <p>For Mean Variance Optimization to give correct results requires that all the inputs are correct, meaning the expected returns, correlations and standard deviations are right for each asset class. If any one input is invalid, then the entire model falls apart.</p>
              <p>Here is a recent example:</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box">
                <p>Suppose you were developing an investment plan in December 1999 to meet the long-term retirement needs for a client. In entering the three primary variables required to do MVO, you probably would have overstated expected returns and understated volatility (in light of what we know today regarding the post-1999 market). While you intuitively knew the market could not continue to provide the amazing returns of 1998-99 forever, you had to use the averages for your calculations. The skewing of the data would lead to improper planning and asset allocation.
                </p>
                <p>What is the likelihood of that happening? MVO alone will not provide an answer. </p>

      <div class="p7AP3trig p7ap3-theme-03">
        <h3><a href="#p7AP3c1_2" id="p7AP3t1_2">Issue #2</a></h3>

              <p>Traditional modeling analyzes a client&rsquo;s situation based on a given average rate of return over a given time period – such as the client&rsquo;s life expectancy. The problem is that while the average return will most likely be accurate over the long term, the actual timing of the returns year to year can have a significant impact on achieving goals.</p>
              <p>This is illustrated in the following example:</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box"><p>Suppose two investors each place $100,000 with an investment manager, to be invested for 3 years. Both have a goal of achieving an average annual return of 10%. The following are the results they achieve:<br>
              <table id="tableAlignLeft">
                <caption style="text-align:center;">
                Annual Returns
                </caption>
                <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th scope="col" class="table-heading-c1"></th>
                  <th scope="col">1st Year</th>
                  <th scope="col">2nd Year</th>
                  <th scope="col">3rd Year</th>
                </tr>
                </thead>
                                <tr>
                                  <th scope="row">Investor 1</th>
                                  <td>20%</td>
                                  <td>15%</td>
                                  <td>(5%)</td>
                                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th scope="row">Investor 2</th>
                  <td>(20%)</td>
                  <td>20%</td>
                  <td>30%</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p><br>
                If we were to simply look at the annual average return for each investor over this 3 year period, we would find each had the same “average annual return” – 10%.  However, the actual portfolio values for each at the end of the three years Is dramatically different.  Investor #1 would have $131,100 and Investor #2 would have $124,800.                </p>
              <p>This shows the importance of the timing and sequencing of returns in modeling asset allocation strategies because the actual returns year over year, and the volatility of those returns, does have an impact on the total wealth accumulation in a portfolio.</p>

<p>Both of these examples illustrate that modeling solely on the basis of averages provides an incomplete solution. Yet that is exactly what MVO does. Clearly, more sophisticated investment planning requires a more dynamic approach than can be achieved in static Mean Variance Optimization alone. Such an approach is provided by <strong>Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis.</strong> Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis will allow us to test our projections of our investment objectives being defeated by short-term variations such as those illustrated on this page.</p>
