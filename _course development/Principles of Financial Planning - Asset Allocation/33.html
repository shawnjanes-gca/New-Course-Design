  <p>While a plan may appear perfectly solid when looking at the averages, many things can go wrong in the real world that might cause the plan to fail. For example, investment returns might be lower than expected, or the timing of an investment may be wrong, or death may occur sooner (or later) than planned. To have confidence in a plan, it is important to test it against various possibilities to establish an acceptable level of confidence that unexpected events</p>
  <p>Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis makes this possible. Grounded in gaming theory, where expected outcomes are modeled multiple times to establish probabilities of a single occurrence, <strong>Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis is a powerful tool available in many portfolio optimization software packages. Monte Carlo Analysis allows you to perform risk/probability simulations over multiple scenarios to determine a "success rate" for a given plan.</strong> Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis also makes use of some of the same primary inputs as Mean Variance Optimization: expected returns, standard deviation of returns and correlations. However, it uses them in a more sophisticated manner.

  <p><span class="pageInstruction" style="color:red">Here is an overview of how the analysis works:</span></p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">First, the software randomly generates numbers for uncertain variables such as interest rates, investment volatility, and life expectancy. By running hundreds, sometimes thousands of scenarios using randomized data points for annual return that fit within the historical range of expectations, Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis allows you to test the estimated success of the current plan data under different scenarios.
  <br><br>This allows you to answer such questions as: “What is the potential likelihood that I will outlive my portfolio?” or “Can I count on having enough money to fund my education needs?”
  <br><br>This testing will provide you with a more realistic perspective on the viability of a plan achieving the desired goals in a dynamic environment where market returns cannot be predicted, either year to year or over intermediate periods of time.
