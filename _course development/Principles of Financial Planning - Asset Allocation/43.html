  <p>Most investors buy and sell securities on emotions. They tend to follow the pack, buying after most of the opportunity for gain is gone and selling after most of the decline has occurred. Such behavior is a recipe for poor performance, if not disaster.</p>
  <p>You can offer a better approach. Using the knowledge you have gained from this course, you can offer a rational methodology that places emphasis on:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
   <li>Proper allocation instead of picking hot stocks.</li>
   <li>Diversification of risk.</li>
   <li>Portfolios that are built around client needs, risk tolerances, and time horizons.</li>
   <li>Testing portfolios to minimize outcome risk.</li>
   <li>Ongoing monitoring and reallocation.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>The end result for the client is peace of mind - greater confidence in the expected results and lowers anxiety throughout the process.</p>
  <p>Apply yourself to not only master the techniques of proper asset allocation, but to also master your ability to communicate the techniques and their advantages to clients. By helping them to become more knowledgeable themselves, they will have higher confidence in the role you play and place greater value in the services you provide.</p>
