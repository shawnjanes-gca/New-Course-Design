  </h1>
  <p>Three inputs are required to discern the Mean Variance Optimization (MVO) for any group of securities.</p>
  <ol>
<li>Expected returns for each asset</li>
<li>Return volatility (or standard deviation) of each asset</li>
<li>Correlation coefficient for every pair of assets in the portfolio</li>
</ol>
  <p>The third input, "correlation coefficient" needs some explanation. Correlation is defined as the degree to which two asset classes or investments will have similar returns (or act the same) under a specific set of market or economic conditions. Stated differently, it is a measure of how much the return of two investments "co-relate" to each other.</p>
  <p>Typically, investments with "like" make-ups and "like" results have high correlation. Likewise, investments with "unlike" make-ups and "unlike" results have low correlation. This is illustrated in the following diagram, which shows how two indices correlate to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
