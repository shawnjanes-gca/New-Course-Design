<p>With MVO, we can input expected return, standard deviation, and correlation of multiple assets (asset classes) and examine the possible risk return profiles of various allocations among those assets (asset classes). Since the possible combinations are extensive, the outcome is best captured graphically. The diagram (right) shows the risk profiles of various combinations of assets by plotting their risk (as measured by standard deviation) on the X-axis and expected return on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>As we increase the number of plotted points for various risk profiles, we will eventually end up with a border, which is depicted by the line AC. The boomerang effect of this line, causing the border to curve back at BC, is the result of the correlation between securities, which we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Clearly, any rational investor would seek to maximize the returns provided from any given level of risk. This would be found along the line depicted by AB. Any asset allocation falling on this line from A to B, known as the <em><strong>Efficient Frontier</strong></em>, would be the most efficient combination possible for any given level of risk. Investors would prefer to avoid profiles that fall inside the curve, as those combinations represent a lesser return for any given level of risk. They would also avoid those profiles falling on the line depicted by BC, since these are the most inefficient profiles available for a given level of risk.</p>
