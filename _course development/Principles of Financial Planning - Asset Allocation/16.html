  <p>Taking a final look at the impact of time, the following chart depicts the percentage of times an asset class was the top performer in various time periods.</p>
  <p>Observe that stocks outperformed bonds and money market instruments in 57% of the one-year periods. With longer periods, stocks outperformed other asset classes more frequently. <strong>For time periods of 25 years, there is only one instance of stocks being outperformed, and that was the 25 year period ending in 2008.</strong></p>
  <p>From these historical patterns, it is self-evident that the longer the time horizon of the investor, the greater the percentage of stocks a portfolio should contain.</p>
