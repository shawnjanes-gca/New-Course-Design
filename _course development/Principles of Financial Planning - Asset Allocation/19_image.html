  <p>Earlier, we stated that risk is generally measured by looking at the variation in a security’s rate of return, measured in standard deviations. But measuring the variation of a security’s rate of return is of limited use unless it is done in comparison to a benchmark. For example, let’s assume for the moment that a security’s return is only tied to changes in its price. Wide swings in a stock’s price that are perfectly in sync with a volatile market might indicate that the stock is no riskier than the market as a whole, while wide price swings on a stock’s price during a stable market might indicate that the stock is significantly riskier than the market as a whole. This movement of a stock’s return relative to the movement of the market can be statistically measured and is called <strong>covariance.</strong> Stated differently, <strong>covariance measures the extent of mutual variation between any two variables.</strong></p>
  <p>The CAPM uses a concept known as <strong>beta (ß)</strong> to measure the covariance between a stock and the market. In other words, <strong>beta (ß)</strong> is a measure of how a stock moves relative to movements in the market. If the beta of each stock in a portfolio is known, then the beta of a portfolio can be easily determined by calculating a weighted average of the betas of all the stocks in the portfolio. In this manner, beta can be used to speak of the risk of a stock or a portfolio relative to the market.</p>
  <p>A high beta means that the stock is riskier than the market as a whole; a low beta means it is less risky than the market. If a security moves perfectly in sync with market movements (in the same direction and to the same degree), then it has a beta coefficient of 1.0.</p>
