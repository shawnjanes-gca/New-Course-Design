  <p>The third type of risk, outcome risk, is often overlooked. But it is probably the most important risk for investors to consider.</p>
  <p>Outcome risk is the risk that the final outcome of the investment plan will fail to meet an obligation or to achieve a desired result over a specified time. If the expected return of a portfolio is below the desired outcome, then the shortfall is a measure of the outcome risk. For example, if the expected return of an investment for a child's education fails to provide enough money when it is needed, then the portfolio has significant outcome risk.</p>
  <p>Investors normally tend to focus on short-term risk or market risk and often overlook outcome risk because it is “in the future”. But it must always be kept in mind because it is the reason why it has historically been necessary to accept some amount of short-term volatility. Failure to accept some short-term risk might mean never attaining one’s long-term goals.</p>
