<h2>Beta as a Measure of a Stock's Relative Risk</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier, we stated that risk is generally measured by looking at the variation in a security's rate of return, measured in standard deviations. But measuring the variation of a security's rate of return is of limited use unless it is done in comparison to a benchmark. For example, let's assume for the moment that a security's return is only tied to changes in its price. Wide swings in a stock's price that are perfectly in sync with a volatile market might indicate that the stock is no riskier than the market as a whole, while wide price swings on a stock's price during a stable market might indicate that the stock is significantly riskier than the market as a whole. This movement of a stock's return relative to the movement of the market can be statistically measured and is called <em><strong>covariance</strong></em>. Stated differently, <em><strong>covariance measures the extent of mutual variation between any two variables</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The CAPM uses a concept known as <em><strong>beta (<em>&szlig;</em>)</strong></em> to measure the covariance between a stock and the market. In other words, <em><strong>beta (<em>&szlig;</em>)</strong></em> is a measure of how a stock moves relative to movements in the market. If the beta of each stock in a portfolio is known, then the beta of a portfolio can be easily determined by calculating a weighted average of the betas of all the stocks in the portfolio. In this manner, beta can be used to speak of the risk of a stock or a portfolio relative to the market.</p>
<p>A high beta means that the stock is riskier than the market as a whole; a low beta means it is less risky than the market. If a security moves perfectly in sync with market movements (in the same direction and to the same degree), then it has a beta coefficient of 1.0.</p>

<p><strong>0.5</strong></p>
<p>Beta coefficients below 1.0 indicate that the stock or portfolio is less risky than the market as a whole. Thus, the risk premium is less than that of the market. When the market rises, the stock (portfolio) will not be expected to rise as much; when the market declines, the stock (portfolio) will be expected to decline to a lesser degree.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>If the risk premium (the rate above the risk-free rate) for the market is 8%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would have a risk premium of 0.5 x 8% = 4%.</p>
