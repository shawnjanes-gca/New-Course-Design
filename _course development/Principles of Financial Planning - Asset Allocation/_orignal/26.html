<p>In actual practice, beta is not the most effective measure of risk in investing. Nor is it very intuitive. There had to be a better, more robust way to model risk and portfolio returns. Harry Markowitz accepted that challenge in his approach called "Modern Portfolio Theory."</p>
<p>Markowitz used mathematics to establish an approach for modeling efficient investment portfolios using multiple securities. His seminal work was titled "Portfolio Selection" and focused on <em><strong>how to allocate assets among various alternatives to achieve the highest level of return for any level of risk incurred.</strong></em></p>
<p>Whereas the CAPM defined risk of a stock by its relationship to the market (<em><strong>&szlig;</strong></em>), Markowitz' Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) uses standard deviation in measuring the risk of a stock or portfolio. Standard deviation measures the variability of returns, or unpredictability of returns, irrespective of association to the general market. In actual practice, this probably displays a truer picture of how investors view their investments. After all, they are generally more concerned with the overall variability of the return on their stock or portfolio than they are with its sensitivity to market movements.</p>
<p>While initially designed to address allocation of assets among various common stocks, the thesis has been extended to address asset allocation in the traditional context where investors are attempting to determine <em> <strong>the most efficient mix of various asset classes</strong></em>, not just various stocks. Thus, Modern Portfolio Theory has greater relevance to the subject of asset allocation.</p>
