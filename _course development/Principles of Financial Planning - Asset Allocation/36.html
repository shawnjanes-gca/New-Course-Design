  </h1>
  <p>Now that we have examined the principles, theories, and techniques of asset allocation, let's turn our attention to the process by which asset allocation is implemented with clients.</p>
  <p>There are two general approaches to asset allocation: Strategic and Tactical.</p>
  <p><strong>Strategic asset allocation</strong> is designed for a longer-term perspective. In this process, portfolios are not traded frequently but are simply rebalanced periodically to maintain the desired asset allocation that is most likely to reach the longer-term objectives of the client. The chart below helps describe the process of strategic asset allocation.</p>

Before generating a mix of assets within a portfolio, there must be an understanding of the goals and expectations of the client.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being aware of such goals as the amount of risk willing to be taken, the amount of return desired and the time frame with which these goals can be reached, is essential in the strategic asset allocation process.&lt;/p&gt;" >

The historical returns and volatility inputs are factual and cannot be debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the averages used here can be significantly different depending on the time period chosen to determine these data inputs. Be careful to utilize rational expectations and discuss the impact of a lower return environment.&lt;/p&gt;" >

  <p>Because strategic asset allocation is based on client objectives, it must take into consideration the time horizons associated with these objectives.</p>
  <p><span class="pageInstruction">Below are examples of client/prospect objectives and the time horizons typically associated with them:</span></p>

  <div class="imageRight"><img src="greene/pfp_asset_allocation/images/Strategic_Asset_Allocation_Client_Prospect_Example.ai.png" width="342" height="264" alt=""/></div>
<p>An investor may be saving for a new home, or education for children, the care of aging parents, or retirement.
</p>
    <p>Each of these objectives has a specific time frame associated with it, and assets need to be allocated to asset classes that provide the best risk/return relationship consistent with the time frame in question .</p>
