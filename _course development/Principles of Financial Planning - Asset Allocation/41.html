  <p>There are many different opinions on how often a portfolio allocation should be reviewed and optimized. Some say quarterly, others annually. The specific timeframe for revisiting and re-optimizing is not as important as actually doing it on a regularly scheduled basis.</p>
  <p>Given the dynamic nature of the markets, and the ever-changing perspectives and needs of your clients, you are wise to schedule a review of the portfolio positions at least annually. And if the assets are in a trust account, an annual review is a requirement under Reg. 9.</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box"><strong>Reg. 9 Review</strong>
  <p>This review should include the following information and perspective:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
   <li>Have there been any changes in the objectives of the client?</li>
   <li>Have there been any changes in the risk tolerances of the client?</li>
   <li>What are the current asset class weightings compared to the investment policy parameters set out in the plan?</li>
   <li>What would be the transaction costs of re-balancing at this point?</li>
   <li>Are there any tax considerations that need to be addressed or factored into the re-balancing?</li>
   </ul>
