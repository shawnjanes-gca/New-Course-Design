  <p>The fact is that while the CAPM ignores performance variations outside expected returns, such variations do in fact exist. And while the efficient market theory dictates that portfolio managers cannot achieve "excess" return, history has shown that, for given periods of time, some in fact do achieve excess return, while others underperform.</p>
  <p>A key term used in asset allocation to account for the impact of the portfolio manager on performance is <strong>alpha (a).</strong> This term, whose basis is in CAPM theory, can be especially helpful as you seek to allocate investments among different money managers to achieve diversification.</p>

The higher your alpha, the better your portfolio has done in achieving “excess returns. It is generally considered to be a measure of the “value added” by the portfolio manager. The higher the alpha, the higher the “value added” by the portfolio manager, while a negative alpha indicates that the portfolio manager’s efforts were counterproductive, resulting in diminished returns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The market portfolio alpha is always zero.&lt;/p&gt;" >

R2 ranges from 0 to 100%, with a score of 100% indicating that all movements of the portfolio are completely explained by the benchmark index. In general, the higher the R2, the more reliable a portfolio's alpha and beta measurements will be.&lt;/p&gt;" >

<p><strong>Alpha compares the expected return of a stock or portfolio (based on its beta) to its actual return.</strong> If a portfolio's actual return over time is greater than expected, then this is deemed "excess return." The question to be answered is: "What is the cause of this excess return?" For example, is it caused by a corresponding excess return in the market? If so, then the CAPM works to fully explain the situation. Or is this excess caused by an independent factor, such as the skill of the portfolio manager?</p>
  <p>To answer this question, the chart on the right samples the return of a portfolio over time and plots the portfolio's excess return against the excess return of the market for the same time period. After taking the samples, regression analysis is used to plot a line through the samples that represents the average of the scattered plots. If the CAPM holds, the portfolio should have zero excess return when the market has zero excess return and the line should intercept the axis at zero. When that doesn't happen, another factor has been introduced, which either caused excess return (causing the line to intercept above the horizontal axis) or it caused diminished return (causing the line to intercept below the horizontal axis). <strong>Alpha is the magnitude of the distance from the horizontal axis to the point where the line intercepts the vertical axis.</strong> Generally speaking, alpha is used as a measure of the portfolio manager's contribution to the performance of the portfolio.</p>
