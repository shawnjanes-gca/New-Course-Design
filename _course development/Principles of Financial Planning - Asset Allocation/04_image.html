  <p>Over long periods of time, the comparative returns of stocks, bonds, and T-bills (money market instruments) have remained fairly consistent, with stocks having provided the highest return on investment. As the chart below shows, this relative performance has not been repeated in recent times.</p>
  <p><!-- Insert image --></p>
  <p>Over the past 5 years, stocks have reached rates of return slightly higher than for the past 25 years. Given this above average performance, investors must ask themselves, "Are shorter-term stock returns more reflective of future returns or will returns gravitate back to a more historic norm?"</p>
  <p>How this question is answered may have significant impact on the investment decisions that are made.</p>
