  </h1>
  <p>The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is the primary theory behind a number of current asset allocation practices. Therefore, an understanding of the CAPM is essential to understanding those practices. </p>
  <p>The CAPM describes the relationship between risk and expected return, and it serves as a model for the pricing of risky securities.</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">Simply stated, the CAPM states that the expected return of a security or a portfolio equals the rate of return on a risk-free security (like T-Bills) plus a risk premium</div>
  <p>In other words, for investors to assume the incremental risk of holding the stock, they demand a premium rate of return beyond the risk-free rate. The greater the risk they must assume, then the greater the premium demanded. </p>
  <p>The CAPM examines this risk premium of a stock relative to the risk premium of the stock market as a whole, for which the S&P 500 generally acts as a proxy. If a stock is riskier than the market as a whole, then its risk premium must be greater than that for the market for investors to purchase it. If it is less risky than the market as a whole, then its risk premium will be less than that of the market.</p>
  <p>But how do you measure the risk of a stock relative to the market?</p>
