  </h1>
  <p>Three inputs are required to discern the Mean Variance Optimization (MVO) for any group of securities.</p>
  <ol>
<li><span>Expected returns for each asset</span></li>
<li><span>Return volatility (or standard deviation) of each asset</span></li>
<li><span>Correlation coefficient for every pair of assets in the portfolio</span></li>
</ol>
  <p>The third input, "correlation coefficient" needs some explanation. Correlation is defined as the degree to which two asset classes or investments will have similar returns (or act the same) under a specific set of market or economic conditions. Stated differently, it is a measure of how much the return of two investments "co-relate" to each other.</p>
  <p>Typically, investments with "like" make-ups and "like" results have high correlation. Likewise, investments with "unlike" make-ups and "unlike" results have low correlation. This is illustrated in the following diagram, which shows how two indices correlate to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

That is, when the Dow has increased 1 percent, in general, the S&amp;P 500 has historically increased at a similar rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two indices are slightly different in that the Dow Jones Industrial Average contains 30 stocks each with a large capitalization and the S&amp;P 500 has 500 stocks. So one is substantially larger than the other, but they are both representative of highly capitalized corporations and therefore have had a relatively high degree of correlation to other.&lt;/p&gt;" >
