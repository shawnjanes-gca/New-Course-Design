  <p>In quantifying market risk, we begin to make a transition from the basics that nearly everyone understands to the more intricate aspects of asset allocation theory and its application in todayâ€™s environment. The common way to measure market risk is through an examination of the dispersion of returns over a given time period. This can be measured in standard deviations, which is a statistical measure for quantifying the dispersion of returns around the mean (average). The greater the standard deviation, the more volatile the asset is and the greater its risk.</p>
  <p>To understand standard deviation and its application in the measurement of market risk, look at the following chart. It represents what is referred to as a normal distribution of events. When a series of events follow a normal distribution, we can begin to predict the future events within a given probability.</p>
