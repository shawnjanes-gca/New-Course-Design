    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Because the purchaser of a universal policy bears some of the interest rate risk, universal policies are typically less expensive than whole life coverage and the interest rate is typically higher. Should market rates increase significantly, the rate in the universal policy might also increase, making it possible to reduce the premium payments. Of course, premiums could also increase if rates decline.</p>
  <p>It is also worth noting that a return within an insurance policy is tax-deferred. This can make a universal policy an appealing investment vehicle. And as shown in the preceding illustration, it is possible to have a sizeable amount of funds earning tax-deferred interest.</p>
  <p>To prevent universal policies from being used more for investment purposes than for the insurance protection they provide, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982 created what is known as the <strong><em>TEFRA Corridor</em></strong>. This act imposed limits on the cash value allowed in a universal policy, requiring that it could not exceed a specified percentage of the policy's face amount. The specific limitation depends upon the insured's age.</p>
  <p>If the cash value exceeds these limits, then the policy is treated strictly as an investment account and taxed accordingly. As a result, insurers will not allow the cash in the account to exceed these limits. In fact, most policies will state that if cash value does exceed these percentages, then the face amount will automatically increase to stay within the TEFRA corridor. </p>
