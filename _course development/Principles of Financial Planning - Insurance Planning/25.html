<p>Is a professional baseball player earning $3,000,000 per year functionally disabled if he injures his knee sliding into third and can no longer play major league ball? That depends on the definition of disability in his policy. While he may no longer be able to play major league baseball, he can still earn a living as a business executive. This illustrates why the specific definition contained in the policy is a very important issue to understand when dealing with disability insurance.</p>

<p><strong>Also known as "Any Occ"</strong></p>
<p>Policies with this definition provide coverage when the insured is disabled to the point that he or she can no longer work in <em><strong>any occupation</strong></em>. This type of coverage would be meaningless for the professional athlete. Despite the loss of his professional career, he can still be gainfully employed in a wide array of other professions.</p>

<p><strong>Also known as "Own Occ"</strong></p>
<p>Less common, and more expensive for the insured, "own occupation" coverage replaces income when the insured is no longer able to perform in his or her current occupation. Surgeons or dentists are examples of persons who might need this type of coverage, as would the baseball player. Should any of these persons be in an accident where they lose a hand, they could no longer perform their current duties. "Any occupation" coverage would not cover their "disability," since they could still earn a living teaching, but an "own occupation" policy would. This coverage is issued for the highest paid occupational classes, and consequently has the highest premiums relative to other types of policies.</p>
