<p><strong>Who Can Sell Variable Policies</strong></p>
<p>Because the purchaser assumes all the investment risk, variable policies must be registered with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) and can only be sold by licensed broker dealers. Potential purchasers must also be presented with a prospectus at or prior to the initial sales call.</p>
<p>This prospectus will outline the expenses of the policy, the investment options, past performance of the funds, the benefit provisions, surrender charges, and the policy owner's rights.</p>

<p>The variable life insurance policy goes one step further by <em><strong>allowing the purchaser to completely assume the investment risk</strong></em>. Rather than placing premiums in the insurer's general funds, premiums of a variable life policy are placed in separate investment accounts, called <em> <strong>separate accounts</strong></em>. These separate accounts allow the owner to control the investments of the fund and present the owner with a number of investment options that are typically available only through mutual funds. A typical combination of accounts would include at least one money market fund, bond fund, and equity fund. The purchaser is allowed to allocate the premiums among those funds, and can periodically reallocate the mix.</p>
<p><strong>The death benefit AND cash value of these policies are allowed to vary</strong>, reflecting the investment performance of the underlying investment funds. Most policies will guarantee that the face amount will never go below a certain level. But they will not guarantee investment earnings, nor will they guarantee a minimum cash value.</p>
