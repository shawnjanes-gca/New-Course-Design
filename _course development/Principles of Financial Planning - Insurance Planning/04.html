  <p>People go through three basic cycles in their financial lives. While these three stages tend to be a function of age, that is not always the case. They are more a matter of a person's state of mind and objectives. Likewise, these stages may not necessarily be exclusive to one another, since they quite often overlap.</p>
  <p>Think about these stages of financial life as they relate to client needs and objectives. Where individuals are focused regarding their wealth will provide an indicator of the types of needs they will be most interested in resolving. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each stage for more information:</span></p>

Their overriding concern is for strategies that help them either accumulate wealth or protection for themselves and their family against risks that might prevent them from completing their drive for wealth.&lt;/p&gt;">

In other words, they want to prevent the possibility of having to lower their standard of living due to a major financial disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that the person has necessarily passed beyond wealth accumulation; it could simply mean that they wish to protect what they have while they continue to strive for more.&lt;/p&gt;" >

In this stage, the concern is for the best alternatives to pass money on to heirs. Although this typically becomes a primary concern for an older person, even a younger person can also be concerned about properly planning for how their wealth will ultimately transfer.&lt;/p&gt;" >
