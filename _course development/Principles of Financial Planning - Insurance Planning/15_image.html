  <p>Universal Life Insurance was developed to respond to increased demand for financial products that offered more flexibility than standard life contracts. </p><h3>Unbundled Pricing and Flexible Premiums</h3></p>
  <p>Unlike the traditional whole life insurance, the various pricing factors of a Universal policy (mortality charge, expenses, interest) are unbundled and stated independently of each other. To understand how this operates, think of an empty tank into which the policy owner pours the premium payments. Various cash flows go into or out of the tank, some involving the owner, others involving the insurer. Whatever remains in the tank at any point in time is the cash value of the policy.</p>
