  <p>Term life insurance has <strong>no cash value</strong> and offers <strong>no savings or investment benefit</strong>. But it does provide a <strong>death benefit</strong> if death occurs during a stated period of time (typically a year). That makes it the most basic and least expensive type of life insurance available.Â  Term life insurance is usually issued in one of the forms listed below. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each form to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>Allows the policy owner the right to convert to a permanent policy, without requiring evidence of insurability, although this right makes the insurance more expensive. The conversion is usually limited in some way, either stating the age by which it must be converted or limiting the percentage of the term coverage that can be converted. Premiums upon conversion may be computed in one of two ways:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Attained Age Conversion      -</strong> Rate is based on the      insured's age at the time of conversion. </li>
                <li><strong>Original Age Conversion -</strong> Rate is based on the insured's age when the term policy was originally purchased. Of course, this would result in lower premiums than the Attained Age Conversion.            </li>

              <p>The initial premiums of term life insurance are generally less than those of permanent life insurance. That makes it more affordable for younger clients with limited funds. It also makes it the better choice when the need for life insurance is for a short, limited time, as might be the case when required to have term insurance before receiving approval on a loan.</p>

              <p>But over time, term insurance premiums typically increase as the policy is renewed for the same amount of coverage. Permanent insurance is issued with a level premium that is higher than term insurance when issued at a given age, but becomes less expensive than term insurance as the insured ages.</p>
              <p>Thus, the appeal of low initial premiums must be balanced against the fact that premiums of term life insurance will be higher in later years. Where the need for life insurance is long-term, total cost of insurance may be less with permanent insurance. It is also important to keep in mind that one's insurability might decline over the years, and coverage might eventually be lost with term insurance when it could have been retained with permanent insurance. </p>
