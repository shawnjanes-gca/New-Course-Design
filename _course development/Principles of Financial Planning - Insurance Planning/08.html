  <p>For each of these stages, insurance can help manage the risk and provide potential infusion of cash at critical junctures. The diagram below illustrates some of the insurance solutions that may be relevant at each stage of the financial lifecycle. These solutions are discussed in more detail in subsequent training modules. For now, learn the basic definition of each and understand how each can be applied to manage the risks and objectives associated with each stage of the financial lifecycle.</p>

                <p>Term Life is life insurance that has no cash value and pays benefits only if death occurs during a stated term of time (typically a year). Premiums are initially lower than permanent life insurance, making it more affordable for younger people.</p>

                <p>Variable Life is permanent life insurance where the investment risk is shifted to the owner of the policy. The owner can allocate the accumulated funds among separate accounts, each with different investment objectives. Both the death benefit AND cash value of the policy will fluctuate based on the investment performance of these funds. Over time, this type of insurance can provide better investment returns than traditional whole life policies and may be a preferred means of tax-deferred savings. Because the owner is assuming the investment risk, the SEC has determined that these policies are investment vehicles and must be sold by licensed broker/dealers.</p>

                <p>Whole Life insurance provides lifetime insurance coverage with a guaranteed level premium, which in turn allows a guaranteed death benefit and guaranteed cash values. Growth in policy cash values is tax-deferred.</p>
                <p>Some policies participate in the profit of the insurance company.  In such cases, surplus earnings (due to better than projected expenses, investment returns and mortality experience) are returned to the policy holders in the form of non-taxable dividends (not guaranteed). The dividends can be used in a variety of ways at the election of the policyholder, e.g., to reduce premiums, accumulate interest, purchase additional insurance, etc. </p>

                <p>Funding a Universal Life policy with flexible premium payments is analogous to keeping enough gas in your car to keep the car running. If premium payments are insufficient to maintain the administrative and mortality charges in the policy, the premiums will need to be increased significantly to “catch-up” with current and future charges and/or the death benefit will need to be decreased. If neither of these adjustments is done or is insufficient, the policy will lapse.</p>

                <p>Whole Life insurance provides lifetime insurance coverage with a guaranteed level premium, which in turn allows a guaranteed death benefit and guaranteed cash values. Growth in policy cash values is tax-deferred.</p>
                <p>Some policies participate in the profit of the insurance company.  In such cases, surplus earnings (due to better than projected expenses, investment returns and mortality experience) are returned to the policy holders in the form of non-taxable dividends (not guaranteed). The dividends can be used in a variety of ways at the election of the policyholder, e.g., to reduce premiums, accumulate interest, purchase additional insurance, etc. </p>

                <p>This is an agreement where one or more parties agree to purchase the business interest of a person upon his/her death and the liquidity for that purchase is provided for by the purchase of an insurance policy on the life of that person. This may be accomplished by one or more individuals purchasing insurance policies (for example, several partners might purchase policies on each other) or by having the business purchase the policy.</p>
