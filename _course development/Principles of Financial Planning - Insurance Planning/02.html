  <p>All too often the sale of insurance is perceived as a &quot;product push.&quot; But insurance is not a packaged product to be &quot;sold&quot; like a box of cereal. Insurance exists to help people deal with financial risks. In that regard, it is a financial tool, no different than the services provided by investment or trust and estate professionals.</p>
  <p>Investors in the stock market are subject to investment risk. To help them diversify that risk, mutual funds were developed. The wealthy are subject to the risk that transfer taxes will deplete the amount passed on to others. Thus, we have developed very sophisticated planning techniques that avoid unnecessary taxation. </p>
  <p>In a similar fashion, insurance was developed to address certain risks.</p>
