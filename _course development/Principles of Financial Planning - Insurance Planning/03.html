<p>We all live with certain financial risks associated with our own mortality and human frailty. These can have a very significant financial impact in our lives, and we need ways to minimize that exposure. Insurance provides a way to manage those risks.</p>
<p>There are also critical junctures in our lives where an infusion of cash can be critical, such as the need to pay estate taxes without having to liquidate the family business when the founder dies. There, too, insurance can provide the security that the cash will be there when the anticipated need arises.</p>
<p>Highly adaptable to individual needs, it is much more a financial planning tool than it is a product. For its proper use, the financial services professional should begin with the human needs under consideration, and then ask if insurance is a viable solution. This is precisely the process that will be presented in the following pages.</p>
