  <p>The Final type of permanent insurance is <strong><em>endowment life insurance</em></strong>. It is somewhat like whole life insurance, which &quot;matures&quot; at the death of the insured and pays out the face amount, but which also pays out the face amount if the insured reaches age 100. The only difference is that with an endowment policy, the face amount will be paid to the insured upon a specified date other than the insured's 100th birthday. This might be a specific date, such as January 1, 2020, or it might be upon the insured reaching a particular birthday. For example, if the specified date is the insured's 70th birthday, the benefits will be paid either when the insured dies or upon the insured reaching his or her 70th birthday, whichever occurs first.</p>
  <p>Such policies can provide insurance protection while at the same time providing funds for retirement or to meet an anticipated demand for funds. Because the policy has a known maturity prior to the insured reaching 100 years of age, it will accumulate cash value more quickly than whole life insurance. However, IRS does not treat these policies as life insurance contracts for federal income tax purposes.</p>
