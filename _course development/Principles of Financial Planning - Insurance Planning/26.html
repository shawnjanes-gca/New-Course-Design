  <p>While the taxation of disability benefits can become complex, the general rule is: <strong><em>whenever an individual pays premiums on an after-tax basis, the benefits will be tax-exempt.</em></strong></p>
  <p>One complication to note, however, comes into play with Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) benefits. Under Social Security, disabled workers have access to some disability coverage, albeit very limited. These benefits are not taxable until the client meets certain thresholds of income. Most affluent clients will typically have their SSDI treated as taxable income.</p>
