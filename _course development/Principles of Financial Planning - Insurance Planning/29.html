  <p>Thus far we have looked at insurance as a means of managing personal risk of death or disability. But insurance also has a significant role in managing business risk. We typically think of business risks as production, sales and marketing risks. But businesses also depend upon human capital. This dependency subjects the business to the risk that it can lose its human capital through death, illness, injury, retirement, or resignation. Loss of its people can subject the organization to significant financial risk.</p>

              <p>In addition to salaries, companies need incentives to retain employees. Ideally, these incentives are long-term, becoming more valuable with the passage of time and locking in employee loyalty, while minimizing current costs to the employer.</p>
              <p>Insurance can provide viable solutions for these business needs. Listed below are some common insurance solutions.</p>

              <p><strong>Deferred Compensation</strong></p>
              <p>Social Security and Qualified Retirement plans do not always provide sufficient benefit to plan for retirement. One option is for companies to implement a deferred compensation plan. Under the terms of such a plan, the employee and employer enter into an agreement to defer a portion of current compensation until some defined future date or event such as retirement. Under income tax rules governing deferred compensation plans, the employee generally may not change the defined future date or event once established by the agreement. The company uses the funds to purchase insurance to fund the plan. When the employee retires, the cash value of the policy will be used to purchase an annuity to provide retirement income. If the employee dies before retirement, such plans typically use the insurance proceeds to purchase an annuity for the benefit of the surviving family.</p>
              <p><strong>Split-Dollar Arrangements</strong></p>
              <p>This is an arrangement whereby a company makes the purchase of insurance more affordable by agreeing to split the costs with the employee. If the employee leaves the company and wishes to retain the insurance, he/she must typically reimburse the company for its portion of the payments. If the employee dies while the policy is in effect, the company is usually reimbursed for its portion of the premiums but the balance of the proceeds are paid to the beneficiaries. Split-dollar policies have significant income tax planning implications and a tax expert should be consulted when designing such arrangements.</p>

              <p>Some companies have key employees, the loss of whom would jeopardize the profitability or future of the company. A key employee might command high confidence or loyalty from customers, and their loss could negatively impact the cash flows of the company if customers took their business elsewhere. In like manner, creditors might question the future viability of a company that lost a key employee, making it difficult for the company to raise funds.</p>
              <p>Businesses need protection from such a loss, and they may need an influx of cash to provide stability for the company as it seeks to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

              <p>Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and closely held businesses can have difficulty planning for succession. There is often the need to pre-plan the successor for the protection of the ongoing viability of the company, but the chosen successor may not have the liquidity to buy out the interest of the departing person.</p>

              <p>When the departure is due to death, there may be the further complication of a large estate tax bill, where the primary estate asset is the deceased's interest in the business. Failure to properly plan for this contingency could result in an unplanned sale of the business, bringing in outside leadership and possibly diminishing the value of the interest held in the company by other interested parties.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Buy-Sell Agreement</strong></p>
              <p>This is an agreement where one or more parties agrees to purchase the business interest of a person upon his/her death and the liquidity for that purchase is provided for by the purchase of an insurance policy on the life of that person. This may be accomplished by one or more individuals purchasing insurance policies (for example, several partners might purchase policies on each other) or by having the business purchase the policy.</p>
