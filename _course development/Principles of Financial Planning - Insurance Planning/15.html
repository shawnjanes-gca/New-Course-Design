  <p>Universal Life Insurance was developed to respond to increased demand for financial products that offered more flexibility than standard life contracts. </p><h3>Unbundled Pricing and Flexible Premiums</h3></p>
  <p>Unlike the traditional whole life insurance, the various pricing factors of a Universal policy (mortality charge, expenses, interest) are unbundled and stated independently of each other. To understand how this operates, think of an empty tank into which the policy owner pours the premium payments. Various cash flows go into or out of the tank, some involving the owner, others involving the insurer. Whatever remains in the tank at any point in time is the cash value of the policy.</p>

As long as the cash value of the policy is sufficient to pay the periodic charges (e.g., mortality charges and administrative fees) made by the insurer, the policy will stay in force, even if no premium payments are made. And if the owner elects to increase the size of the premiums, the cash value (the balance in the tank) will be higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the premiums are ever insufficient to keep the policy in force, the owner is usually given a notice that the policy will lapse if additional funds are not received within a period of time, typically 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;" >

But with the universal policy, it is also possible to make withdrawals directly from the cash balance.&lt;/p&gt;" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="415,37,502,80" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest on Cash Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy guarantees that the insurer will pay a minimum interest rate on the cash value, with payments usually made to the account monthly. Market conditions may allow for an even higher rate to be paid.&lt;/p&gt;" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="427,302,524,329" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various other expenses will also be charged against the cash value. These charges include a flat charge to cover sale and issuance of the policy, a percentage of the annual premium to cover expenses (e.g., 5%), a monthly administration fee, special service fees for cash withdrawals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="404,339,551,368" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mortality Charge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the charge that is periodically deducted (usually monthly) from the cash value of the account to pay for the life insurance coverage. The amount is based on the insured's current mortality risk, and will typically increase each year, although the policy will limit the amount by which it may increase.&lt;/p&gt;" >
