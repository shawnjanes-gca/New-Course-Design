  <p>While the efficient market theory dictates that portfolio managers cannot achieve &ldquo;excess&rdquo; return, history has shown that, for given periods of time, some in fact do achieve excess return, while others underperform.</p>
  <p>A key term used in asset allocation to account for the impact of the portfolio manager on performance is <strong><em>alpha (a)</em></strong>. This term, whose basis is in CAPM theory, can be especially helpful as you seek to identify managers that have the ability to deliver true value-added returns over and above what would be expected based on the market returns and the risk exposure of the portfolio.  In a basic sense, the alpha is a score that quantifies what many refer to as &ldquo;manager impact&rdquo;, or value- added, either positively or negatively, from the skills of the investment manager.</p>
  <p>The chart below samples portfolio return observations over time and plots the portfolio&rsquo;s excess return against the excess return of the market for the same period. After taking the samples, regression analysis is used to plot a line through the samples that represents the &ldquo;average best fit regression&rdquo; of the scattered plots. If the CAPM holds, the portfolio should have zero excess return when the market has zero excess return and the line should intercept the axis at zero. When that doesn&rsquo;t happen, another factor has been introduced, which either caused excess return (causing the line to intercept above the horizontal axis) or it caused diminished return (causing the line to intercept below the horizontal axis).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alpha is the magnitude of the distance from the horizontal axis to the point where the line intercepts the vertical axis.</em></strong> Generally speaking, alpha is used as a measure of the portfolio manager&rsquo;s contribution to the performance of the portfolio.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Alpha identifies the difference in expected return of a portfolio, based on the beta of the portfolio, versus the actual returns that were achieved. The higher your alpha, the better your portfolio has done in achieving “excess returns”. It is generally considered to be a measure of the “value added” by the portfolio manager. The higher the alpha, the higher the “value added” by the portfolio manager, while a negative alpha indicates that the portfolio manager’s efforts were counterproductive, resulting in diminished returns. 
Note: The market portfolio alpha is always zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta measures the portfolio’s sensitivity to movements in a benchmark index, such as the S&amp;P 500. A beta greater than 1.0 means that the security or portfolio is more volatile than the benchmark index, and a beta less than 1.0 means the asset or portfolio is less volatile.&lt;/p&gt;" >

R2 ranges from 0 to 100%, with a score of 100% indicating that all movements of the portfolio are completely explained by the benchmark index. In general, the higher the R&lt;sup style=&quot;font-size:10px&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the more reliable a portfolio's alpha and beta measurements will be.&lt;/p&gt;" >
