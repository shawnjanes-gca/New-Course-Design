  <p>While understanding the overall returns of a manager or fund can provide some insights, returns alone are not the only perspective that must be examined.  Risk is an important consideration. The <strong><em>Treynor Ratio</em></strong>, also commonly referred to as the <strong><em>reward-to-volatility ratio</em></strong>, is a calculation measuring investment performance adjusted for market risk. It is similar to the Sharpe Ratio, except that it uses Beta as the volatility measurement instead of standard deviation. The ratio divides the difference of the average return of a fund and the risk-free rate by beta (market risk) of the fund. Therefore, it tells us the return over the risk-free rate per unit of market risk. <strong><em>The higher the Treynor Ratio, the better</em></strong> the performance of the manager has been on a risk-adjusted basis.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of how the Treynor Ratio is calculated and used:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Treynor Ratio</strong></p>
    <p>Suppose you have a manager who has produced an average return of 12% over a three-year period during a time when the risk-free rate was 5%.  The difference between the actual performance and the risk-free rate is 7%.  Also assume for this example that the beta of the portfolio is 1.25.</p>
    <p><strong>The Treynor Ratio Calculation:</strong></p>
    <div align="center"><p>(Actual Performance – risk-free rate) / portfolio beta</p></div>
    <div align="center"><p>(12% -5%) / 1.25) = 5.6%</p></div>
