    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The Chartered Financial Analyst Institute (CFA Institute), formerly known as The Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR), is a non-profit industry association that provides rules and guidelines for the investment industry.  This organization has developed very specific standards for performance reporting in an effort to provide a level playing field where all investors can accurately assess performance of managers on a relative and accurate basis.  The following page details some of the key aspects of the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup>, formerly known as the AIMR Performance Presentation Standards (AIMR-PPS), as they were adopted by the Association.  Note that while these are not mandatory, the industry standard is definitively the use of GIPS-compliant calculation and presentation standards.</p>

              <p>The GIPS suggests reporting gross of fees numbers along with a fee schedule.  Keep in mind, however, that the SEC may require net of fees presentation.  A <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The GIPS recommends that performance results be presented&nbsp;gross (before deduction) of management fees, except where this will conflict with the SEC's position on advertising performance. This is&nbsp;because manager's fees are usually scaled resulting in performance&nbsp;information that will not be representative for a portfolio that is much larger or smaller than the size of the portfolio represented by the&nbsp;average fee. The GIPS feels it is more representative to show results before the deduction of management fees and to provide a fee schedule that represents the fee that would actually be paid by the&nbsp;prospective client. The choice of net versus gross is left to the&nbsp;manager, as long as the manager discloses which method is used and&nbsp;includes a fee schedule. When net of fee composite results are shown, the manager must also disclose the weighted average fee.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The SEC staff allows performance information to be presented gross of&nbsp;management fees in one-on-one presentations accompanied with disclosures&nbsp;that (i) the results do not reflect the deduction of investment&nbsp;management fees, (ii) the client's return will be reduced by the&nbsp;management fees and any other expenses incurred in the management of its&nbsp;account, (iii) disclosure of the investment advisory fees are described&nbsp;in Part II of the adviser's Form ADV. Also accompanying these disclosures must be &quot;a representative example&quot; which shows the effect an investment&nbsp;advisory fee, compounded over a period of years, could have on the total value of a client's portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The SEC staff defines one-on-one presentations as manager performance presentations to any client, prospective client, consultant or affiliated group entrusted to consider&nbsp;manager selection and retention. Communications by managers can, therefore, be made to multiple representatives of a given prospect, even&nbsp;if there are several portfolios within the group. Any written performance presentation material distributed to more than one client or prospect, in other than one-on-one presentations, must present performance results&nbsp;after deduction of management fees and cannot present gross of fee&nbsp;performance results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;footer&gt;             &lt;div class=&quot;footertext&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;             &lt;!-- footertext --&gt;             &lt;p&gt;Source: AIMR Newsletter, May - Jun 1995&lt;/p&gt;           &lt;/footer&gt; " class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">discussion</a> from the CFA Institute website helps to clarify.</p>

              <p>This section of the standards addresses the impact of &ldquo;significant cash flows&rdquo; on the performance calculation.</p>
              <p>The manager must have a standard for accounting for large cash flows in and out of the portfolio as these cash flows can alter the geometric calculation of performance over time.  One way is to set a threshold for what is a significant cash flow, such as +/-30%.  At a point where the cash flows exceed this limit, the portfolio is revalued as of the start date or end-of-period date, and adjusted for the cash flows.</p>
              <p>As the rule states, compliance with GIPS Standards will require daily valuation, thereby negating the cash flow issue in the performance calculation.</p>
