  <p>Performance analysis is central to the quantitative evaluation of a manager or investment. But effective due diligence requires more than simplistic comparisons of returns in a basic search for an investment that performs well over 1, 3 and 5 years. As an investment specialist, you will need to go beyond basic performance comparisons that any client can do on their own and deliver a well-conceived and thorough analysis of a manager&rsquo;s ability, skill and consistency over time, as well as the returns they can provide relative to the risk associated with their portfolio.</p>
