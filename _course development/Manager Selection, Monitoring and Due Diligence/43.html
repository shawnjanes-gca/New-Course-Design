    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Here is a situation you may have found yourself in at some point in your career.  You have a client that you have spent a great deal of time working with and have finally established a significant size account.  You have developed an Investment Policy Statement and selected managers and investments designed to meet this client&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
  <p>The performance in the account has not been very good, as the markets have been in turmoil for the last three months.  In every asset class and every investment you have chosen, the account is in negative territory.  Given that this client is very demanding, you have prepared for a meeting with the client.  Immediately after starting the meeting, the client says, &ldquo;I have hired you in good faith based on the approach you showed me and your described ability to select investment managers.  What is going on?  Everything you have selected has performed poorly.  I need an explanation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though there are no required steps that should be followed in presenting a performance report, we suggest the following format listed below. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each step to learn more.</span></p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Start with an overview of the capital markets.  Review how each of the broad asset classes perform, even if certain asset classes are not represented in the investment strategy being reviewed.  Which segments of the market are hot and which are not?</p>

            <h3>Review the Overall Portfolio Strategy</h3>
            <p>Next, review the particular investor&rsquo;s or investment committee&rsquo;s specific asset allocation strategy.  Remind the investor or investment committee of their modeled returns and loss limits.  This is quite possibly the most important step in the overall meeting as it re-establishes the client&rsquo;s objectives, rather than letting the short-term market vagaries define the construct of the discussion.</p>

            <h3>Review the Actual History of the Portfolio Relative to the Objectives</h3>
            <p>While the strategy is critical, it should be discussed in the context of the progress being made towards the identified objectives of the client.  Important here is to show that investing is a long-term process.  To make sure that you are not immediately drawn into a short-term performance discussion, begin by discussing how the investor or investment committee is progressing in meeting the overall investment objectives established in the Investment Policy Statement.</p>

            <h3>Review Recent Period Performance</h3>
            <p>Once addressing the big picture items listed above, it is now relevant to report and discuss how each manager and/or mutual fund is performing relative to an appropriate index, peer group, and monitoring objectives established in the investment policy statement.  A common mistake in preparing the investment policy statement is the failure to compare money managers to appropriate peer groups, or comparing managers to benchmarks that may not be relevant.</p>
            <p>For example, not all equity managers should have their performance compared to the S&amp;P 500.  Equity managers that follow a value strategy should be compared against other value managers.</p>

            <h3>The Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Finally, outline the &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; – what steps need to be taken to meet the objectives established in the investment policy statement.  Do we need to rebalance the portfolio?  Put a manager on the Watch List?  Replace a mutual fund?</p>
            <p>For any specific action that you would recommend or want to discuss with the client, make sure that you are fully prepared to guide them through the pros and cons of the issue and help them make a rational decision in light of their objectives, the IPS and their overall market environment at the time.</p>
