<p>The initial section of this course is dedicated to describing the fundamental tools and methods of analysis that can be used to screen and select appropriate investment alternatives and managers for your clients. The primary role of the investment fiduciary is to manage an investment process. It is not to make the specific investment decisions or an attempt to make individual stock and bond picks. When acting in a fiduciary capacity, you are required to <strong><em>act prudently</em></strong> in implementing the investment strategy and will be held to a "prudent expert" standard. The law does not necessarily mandate the use of professional money managers, but to do otherwise is not recommended. Therefore, for the purposes of this course, we will focus on some of the factors you should consider and utilize when conducting the due diligence process and selecting money managers.</p>
<p>Investment selection decisions are always grounded in the specific goals, objectives, time horizon, risk profile and tax status of the client. Each of these details, as well as other important considerations, should be documented in the Investment Policy Statement. While the purpose of this course is not to detail the specifics of an effective, documented Investment Policy Statement, it is critical to emphasize the importance of developing a mutually understood and communicated IPS with your clients. With this in place, you can begin to employ specific screening and analysis of investment alternatives in an effort to define the best vehicles for your client's portfolio allocations.</p>
