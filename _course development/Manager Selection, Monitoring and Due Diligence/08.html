  </h1>
  <p>Of utmost importance is the investment process and discipline.  The investment process should be well documented and readily articulated.  If a manager cannot discuss the specific steps they use to identify attractive securities, confirm the ideas, construct the portfolio and manage the portfolio on an ongoing basis, you should be suspicious of the manager&rsquo;s ability to repeat past performance in the future.  Remember that you are buying the investment manager and the investment discipline that has been used to produce the results over time.</p>
  <p>Note that some managers have what is referred to as an &ldquo;eclectic&rdquo; investment discipline, meaning they are more dynamic in the way they uncover investment ideas.  While not necessarily a bad investment approach, managers that lack a repeatable discipline should be put to greater levels of scrutiny to ensure that you understand the manager&rsquo;s skill in producing effective returns in the future.</p>

    <h3>How to Evaluate</h3>
    <p>In discussions with a manager, or in review of their literature, look for the ability of the manager to state the stages of their investment process in constructing portfolios, and how they manage those portfolios over time.  Questions pertaining to their screening methodologies, security valuation, research process, diversification standards, and their sell discipline are fundamental components of this analysis.</p>
