<p>In some situations, you will need to rebalance the overall client portfolio and reallocate assets from one manager/portfolio to another in the mix in order to ensure compliance with the Investment Policy Statement. The rebalancing limits established in the investment policy statement define the points when a portfolio should be reallocated to bring it back in line with the strategic asset allocation. The discipline of rebalancing, in essence, controls risk and forces the portfolio to move along a predetermined course. The objective is to take gains from stellar performers or favored asset classes, and reallocate them to lagging styles.</p>
<p>The process of setting an appropriate rebalancing limit is somewhat subjective. Ordinarily, rebalancing limits of plus or minus five percent should keep the parameters tight enough to maintain the risk/return profile of the strategy, yet require rebalancing only once or twice a year. As an example, if the strategic allocation for large-cap growth is 20%, then the rebalancing limits would be set at 15% and 25%. There are no specific rules that you are required to follow. You might determine that a 10% limit is more appropriate. The key is establishing a definitive standard and maintain compliance with the standard, or document and communicate with the client situations where you make exceptions.</p>
