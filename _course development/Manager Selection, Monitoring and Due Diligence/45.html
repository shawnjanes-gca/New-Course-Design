  <p>Once a manager is placed on the Watch List, you now have to establish your procedures for monitoring and evaluating the manager in greater detail. The evaluation of a money manager or fund placed on the Watch List may include:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <div align="center"><h3>Watch List: Manager Evaluation</h3></div>
    <ol start="1" type="1" style="width:95%">
      <li><span>Writing a letter to the money manager asking for an explanation of the underperformance.</span></li>
      <li><span>Analyze recent transactions, holdings, and portfolio characteristics to determine the cause for underperformance and to check for a change in investment style and/or strategy.</span></li>
      <li><span>Meet with or discuss directly with the money manager to gain insight into organizational changes and any changes in strategy or discipline that might be the underlying cause of the underperformance.</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>The decision to retain or terminate a manager cannot be made by a formula or black box.Â  It is the fiduciary&rsquo;s confidence in the money manager&rsquo;s ability to perform in the future that ultimately determines the retention of a money manager.</p>
