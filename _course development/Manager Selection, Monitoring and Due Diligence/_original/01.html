<p>This course provides an overview of requirements for fulfilling the role of an investment fiduciary when selecting investment managers or funds for clients. However, given the wide variety of approaches to open architecture money management and managed accounts, internal processes, procedures and oversight requirements can vary from firm to firm. Therefore, specific guidance on procedures and compliance standards for your firm should be the guiding factors for your consideration.</p>
<p>The course was developed by Greene Consulting, with portions of the course being drawn from material developed by the Center for Fiduciary Studies, which operates in association with the University of Pittsburgh Katz Graduate School of Business. The Center is the first full-time research and training facility devoted to the subject of portfolio management and investment fiduciary responsibility. For further training and to acquire an industry-recognized designation regarding your role as an investment fiduciary, you may wish to enroll in the Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF) program offered through the Center for Fiduciary Studies.
