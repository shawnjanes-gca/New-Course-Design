    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The <strong><em>Sharpe Ratio</em></strong> is a measure of return to volatility and is useful in judging an investment manager&rsquo;s performance versus an index. This ratio was developed by Nobel Laureate William Sharpe.   The Sharpe ratio, also referred to as a measurement of risk-adjusted return, measures excess return per unit of risk taken.  The calculation is made as follows:</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>(Return – Risk-Free Rate of Return) / Standard Deviation</strong></p>
  <p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>Sharpe Ratio</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say a manager generated a return in a portfolio of 30% over a period of time.  The risk-free rate, as measured by 91-day T-bills during the same period, was 3% and the standard deviation of the portfolio was 14% during the same period. </p>
    <p><strong>The risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio) would be:</strong></p>
    <div align="center"><p>(30% - 3%) / 14%  = 1.93%</p></div>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>The Sharpe ratio should be used to compare the relative performance of managers within the same peer group or asset class.  If two managers have the same return, but different levels of volatility (standard deviation), the manager with the higher Sharpe Ratio would be preferable.  Overall, <strong><em>the higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better</em></strong> because a high Sharpe ratio implies the portfolio is achieving good returns for each unit of risk.</p>
