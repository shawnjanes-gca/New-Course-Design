  <p>The intelligent and prudent management of investment decisions requires the fiduciary to maintain a rational, consistent investment program.  The myriad array of investment choices on Wall Street understandably can often result in &ldquo;analysis paralysis&rdquo; from information overload.  Fiduciaries clearly need a framework for making investment decisions that allows them to consider developing investment trends and to thoughtfully navigate the possibilities.</p>
<p>The ideas, approaches and practices identified in this course prescribe a timeless and flexible process for the successful management of investment decisions.  Once familiar with the <em>Practices</em>, the fiduciary will understand that no new investment product or technique will be good or bad per se, nor will it be valuable because it worked for other fiduciaries. </p>
