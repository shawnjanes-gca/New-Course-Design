  <p>While returns are important, as an investment fiduciary you are obligated to review returns in light of the risk exposure of the portfolio as well as the returns that are generated.  Let&rsquo;s first look at how risk can be quantified.</p>
  <p>In quantifying market risk, we begin to make a transition from the basics that nearly everyone understands to the more intricate aspects of asset allocation theory and its application in today&rsquo;s environment. The common way to measure market risk is through an examination of the dispersion of returns over a given time period. This can be measured in <strong><em>standard deviations</em></strong>, which quantifies the dispersion of returns around the mean (average). The greater the standard deviation, the more volatile the manager returns are and the greater the implied volatility/risk.</p>
  <p>To understand standard deviation and its application in the measurement of manager return volatility, look at the following chart. It represents what is referred to as a &ldquo;normal distribution of events.&rdquo;  When a series of events follow a normal distribution, we can begin to predict the future events within a given probability.</p>
