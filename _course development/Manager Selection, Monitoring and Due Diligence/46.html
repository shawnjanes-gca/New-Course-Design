<p>One issue to keep in mind in the re-balancing and re-allocation process pertains to the potential tax implications involved. For taxable client portfolios, the fiduciary should be constantly aware of the tax implications of re-balancing. When it is necessary to re-balance, the fiduciary should estimate the cash flows over the next quarter to determine if the portfolio can be re-balanced with contributions or disbursements.</p>
<p>In most cases, either natural cash flows from the investments themselves, or additions and disbursements from/to the client can be invested in such a way as to keep the portfolio within the established allocation constraints, without having to actually shift assets from one portfolio or manager to another.</p>
