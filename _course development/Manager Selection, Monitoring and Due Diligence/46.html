  </h1>
  <p>In some situations, you will need to rebalance the overall client portfolio and reallocate assets from one manager/portfolio to another in the mix in order to ensure compliance with the Investment Policy Statement.  The rebalancing limits established in the investment policy statement define the points when a portfolio should be reallocated to bring it back in line with the strategic asset allocation.  The discipline of rebalancing, in essence, controls risk and forces the portfolio to move along a predetermined course.  The objective is to take gains from stellar performers or favored asset classes, and reallocate them to lagging styles.</p>
  <p>The process of setting an appropriate rebalancing limit is somewhat subjective.  Ordinarily, rebalancing limits of plus or minus five percent should keep the parameters tight enough to maintain the risk/return profile of the strategy, yet require rebalancing only once or twice a year.  As an example, if the strategic allocation for large-cap growth is 20%, then the rebalancing limits would be set at 15% and 25%.  There are no specific rules that you are required to follow.  You might determine that a 10% limit is more appropriate. The key is establishing a definitive standard and maintain compliance with the standard, or document and communicate with the client situations where you make exceptions. </p>
