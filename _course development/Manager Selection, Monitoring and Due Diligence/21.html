  <p>At the heart of most manager analysis methodologies is the Capital Asset Pricing Model and Modern Portfolio Theory.Â  While this course is not intended to review these topics in depth, it is important to review the models in order to ensure understanding of some key terms and definitions.</p>
  <p>The key message of the CAPM is that there is a direct relationship between risk and return. The implication for purposes of asset allocation is to emphasize the importance of first determining the risk tolerance of the investor, then identifying a portfolio that efficiently achieves a fair return for that given level of risk. Investors should not expect to &ldquo;beat the market&rdquo; unless they intend to have a portfolio that is riskier than the market as a whole.</p>
  <p>The message and implications for the CAPM becomes more easily understood through a graph.</p>
