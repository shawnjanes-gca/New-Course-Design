  <p>The heart of an organization is the people who implement the discipline. When evaluating the people, the first level of review should be focused on the credentials, skills, experience and tenure of the portfolio managers and staff involved in making investment decisions within the portfolio.</p>
  <p>The second level of review is to gain an understanding of what will keep them at the firm over time. This level of review and analysis would address the compensation structure and the overall ownership structure. You are looking to make sure that there is overall organizational stability and a compensation and ownership structure that provides the right incentives for retention of key players in the firm.</p>
  <div class="example-box"><h3>How to Evaluate</h3>
    <p>Evaluating &ldquo;people&rdquo; can seem to be a difficult proposition. What you really are trying to understand and evaluate is a manager&rsquo;s or management team&rsquo;s history and ability to effectively manage portfolios over time. Relative to the individual managers on the portfolio team, you are looking for a person or group that has experience and success in various market environments and cycles. This is a good indicator that the manager brings broad-based experience to the management of the portfolio. Other good indicators for your review would be the manager&rsquo;s previous positions, as well as any industry credentials attained, such as the CFA.</p>
    <p>Relative to the continuity of the manager(s), you want to gain insights into the retention strategy the firm has for the portfolio management team. You are looking for a plan and organizational strategy that provides strong incentives for the portfolio manager or team to stay with the firm over time. Incentive plans tied to asset growth and effective investment performance, as well as the potential for some form of company ownership, are positive indicators of organizational continuity.</p>
