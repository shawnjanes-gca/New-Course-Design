  <p><strong><em>Style drift</em></strong> is performance deviation from a pure or indexed return for the particular style (value, growth, etc.) in question.  It normally occurs when a manager creates portfolios inconsistent with a particular style, i.e., buying value stocks in a growth portfolio or vice versa.  This can occur inadvertently when a manager&rsquo;s discipline is compromised or proactively when the manager&rsquo;s style is out of favor in the market and the manager attempts to add alpha by buying stocks whose style is in favor at the time.  By so doing, managers compromise the strategic allocation the fiduciary has created.  Plotting the manager style analysis based on performance factors or return series data versus the index on a fixed grid permits measurement of style drift.  Over time, you can identify when a manager begins drifting away from the intended and stated style, i.e., chasing returns. To measure style drift, manager returns are plotted on a matrix relative to the various style boxes. A manager&rsquo;s returns will be clearly evident as there will be a snail trail. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here to view a “Snail Trail” for a manager who maintains style discipline.</span></p>

  <p>In this situation, the monthly observations of performance indicate consistent exposure to the Large Cap Core arena. While there are some periods where the exposure wanders into the mid-cap area, the movements are not dramatic and the style trail remains tight indicating consistency relative to the style mandate. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here to view a “Snail Trail” for a manager that begins to chase returns and begins to encounter “Style Drift”.</span></p>

  <p>As you can see, the manager begins the period with a large-cap core orientation, but gradually begins to drift into a mid-cap core and growth bias indicating style drift.</p>
