  <p>The last of the commonly used measurements regarding risk-adjusted returns analysis is the Sortino Ratio.  Named after Frank Sortino, the Sortino Ratio measures investment performance adjusted for downside risk. It is similar to the Sharpe Ratio, except that it uses semi-standard deviation rather than standard deviation as the factor representing volatility in the equation.  The ratio divides the difference of the average return of a fund and the risk-free rate by semi-standard deviation of the fund. Therefore, it tells us the return over the risk-free rate per unit of downside risk. The <strong>higher the Sortino Ratio, the better the performance of the manager has been on a risk-adjusted basis</strong>.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of how the Sortino Ratio is calculated and used:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>Sortino Ratio</h3>
    <p>Suppose you have a manager who has produced an average return of 12% over a three-year period during a time when the risk-free rate was 5%.  The difference between the actual performance and the risk-free rate is 7%.  Also assume for this example that the semi-standard of the portfolio is 2.0.</p>
    <p><strong>The Sortino Ratio Calculation:</strong></p>
    <div align="center"><p>(Actual Performance – risk-free rate) / semi-standard deviation</p></div>
    <div align="center"><p>(12% -5%) / 2.0) = 5%</p></div>
