<p>While two managers might have equal performance records, and even have similar Sharpe Ratios, it does not necessarily mean that they have identical investment approaches. In fact, one manager might invest in small-cap value stocks while another concentrates on finding attractive holdings by focusing on large cap growth stocks. In these cases, style analysis can be used to understand what types of investments they are buying and how they fit into existing portfolios. Financial advisors, money managers, and academics, among others, use style analysis to purchase, classify, or construct managed investments and to monitor them for style drift. Style analysis is also used to construct peer groups and to select appropriate style-specific benchmarks.</p>
