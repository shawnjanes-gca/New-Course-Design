  <p><strong><em>Tracking error</em></strong> is a measurement of a manager&rsquo;s actual performance relative to a policy benchmark.  It is defined as the standard deviation of the periodic differences between the manager&rsquo;s return observations and the return observations of a specific benchmark.  In effect, it is a measurement of the return dispersion versus the benchmark.  The wider the dispersion of returns from the benchmark, the more significant the tracking error and this can be interpreted to show straying from the intended management approach and performance.  Tracking error is a powerful and often used performance monitoring tool as it provides a way to track the performance relationship expected of a manager with statistical significance over short periods of time.</p>
  <h3>Utilizing the Tracking Error Measurement</h3>
  <p>The first step is for the fiduciary to establish the r-squared (correlation) to the benchmark that is required of the manager.  Typically, the r-squared is higher for passive managers (0.99) and lower for active managers (0.90).  With this policy established, the monthly or quarterly evaluation of tracking error can be made.</p>
  <p>Because the tracking error is related to the vagaries of the benchmark, the measurement provides insights into when a manager is not able to effectively manage the portfolio within the defined and required constraints that have been established.  When the tracking error of the manager strays outside of the bounds established, it is indicative of a manager that might be straying outside of the risk exposure parameters that have been defined, or could be an indication of a manager straying from their style mandate or discipline.  While it is not necessarily indicative of a problem in every situation, tracking error can be a quantifiable way to evaluate a manager&rsquo;s performance over various periods.</p>
