    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>There are five primary topics of evaluation when screening and evaluating an investment manager. Often called the five &ldquo;P&rsquo;s&rdquo;, these categories of analysis can be used to gain important insights into the managers and their ability to deliver value-added investment results for your clients over time. Specifically, these five &ldquo;P&rsquo;s&rdquo; are:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>People</li>
    <li>Philosophy</li>
    <li>Process</li>
    <li>Price</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
  </ul>
Of these five primary factors of manager analysis, three are more subjective, qualitative factors in the review. The other two, namely price and performance, are quantitative and therefore much easier to rationalize and comprehend.
