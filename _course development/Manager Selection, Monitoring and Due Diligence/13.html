<h2>Basic Performance Analysis</h2>

<p>While reviewing performance data, it is important for you as a professional, and possibly an investment fiduciary, to have a deeper understanding of how performance can be calculated. This is beneficial not only when you screen managers, but also if you track your investment recommendations in an effort to quantify the impact of your investment selections on the client's overall portfolio returns. In looking at performance analysis, let's first explore the three basic views on investment return that should be used in an analysis.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_1" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Absolute Returns</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In reviewing the performance record, it is typical to look at 1, 3, 5 and possibly 7 and 10 year returns, if available. Each timeframe provides a relevant snapshot of the capabilities of the manager to deliver results; however, they are only the absolute surface of any credible analysis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Benchmark Relative Returns</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Benchmark relative returns provide a one layer deeper perspective than the absolute return views, as they can give insights into performance on a relative basis. Picking the appropriate index or indices to use in making the comparison can be simple in the case of large cap managers where the index is most often the S&amp;P 500. Or it can be a more complex choice when dealing with a more eclectic manager who focuses on smaller segments of the entire equity universe - such as a small cap manager with a penchant for picking high growth stocks where the Russell 2000 might be appropriate, or perhaps another more specialized index could be used.</p>
<p>Regardless of the index, the obvious intent is to gain insights into the manager's ability to generate returns relative to a "passive" or unmanaged portfolio of similar securities. The under or over performance is a possible indicator of a manager's skill level in generating incremental value based on his or her efforts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Peer Relative Returns</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This perspective on performance analysis is used far less by the general investing public, but can provide an interesting perspective on the results the manager has been able to deliver. Because most managers have a specific style, market focus, or other twist they apply in their asset management approach, it is important to make an "apples-to-apples" comparison of the various managers in relation to their peer groups.</p>
