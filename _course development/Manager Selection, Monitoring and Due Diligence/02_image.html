&lt;p&gt;The Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is the foundation of the client’s investment plan and establishes the parameters for the management of the assets.  This statement results in a document that defines the guidelines for the ongoing management of the client’s assets.&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;With the client goals established, the fiduciary is then ready to begin the screening and analysis of investment alternatives that will be used to fulfill the client’s investment plan.  The first section of this course is dedicated to detailing the specific methodologies that can be used to analyze investment managers in order to make an informed and effective decision about the managers before they are hired.  The result of this stage of the process is the identification of managers that are qualified to implement components of the overall investment plan.&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;Once managers are hired, the process of ongoing analysis and screening becomes the primary focus of the fiduciary.  The second section of the course establishes a framework for fiduciaries to use in monitoring the managers.  This monitoring process will result in one of four decisions – maintain status quo, rebalance, put a manager on the “Watch List”, or terminate and find another manager to fulfill the mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
