    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>There is a significant problem using typical <em>standard deviation</em> as a measure of volatility.  This measurement assumes that any volatility around the mean return – or a target return – is bad.  The problem lies in the fact that standard deviation does not discriminate between upside and downside volatility.</p>
  <p>To gain a more accurate insight into the volatility patterns of a manager, a more appropriate risk measure for long-only portfolios is the <strong><em>semi-standard deviation</em></strong> or <strong><em>downside deviation</em></strong> measure.  Semi-standard deviation focuses on the portfolio volatility during under-performing periods of time. In other words, it does not measure the volatility during out-performing periods, but instead analyzes the volatility of portfolio returns when the performance as less than the benchmark or target return expected. A higher semi-standard deviation indicates more volatility in under-performing periods. Therefore, a lower semi-standard deviation is more desirable.  Put another way, the greater the downside volatility of the returns, the higher the downside risk.</p>
  <p>Test Your Knowledge</p>
  <p>A manager has delivered excellent returns during a recent bull market.  In analyzing the longer-term track record to gain insights into their risk profile in down markets, you find that the manager generated returns of -3% and -6% on their portfolio when the markets were -2% and -1% respectively.</p>
