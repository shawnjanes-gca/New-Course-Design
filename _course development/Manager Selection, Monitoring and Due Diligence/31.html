<p>While there is intense scrutiny in the due diligence and selection of managers, the process has to continue over time. In many respects, it is no different than analyzing and buying a stock. While there is a lot of research that takes place prior to the purchase, this does not mean that once it is purchased it no longer requires review. In fact, the review of the stock would continue as long as you hold the investment. Manager or fund selection is no different.</p>
<p>For most fiduciaries, the monitoring phase is the most labor intensive and time-consuming activity of the investment management process and can also be the area where most fiduciary shortfalls occur. It is important to understand that the decisions a fiduciary makes with regards to "how monitoring will be carried out" will have a direct impact on all other phases of the investment management process.</p>
