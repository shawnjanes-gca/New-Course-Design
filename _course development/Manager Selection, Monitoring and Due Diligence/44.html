  <p>Important in the development of a good investment approach where managers are selected is a defined and well-communicated protocol for putting a manager on the &ldquo;Watch List&rdquo;, or as referred to in some firms as a firm &ldquo;Under Review&rdquo;.  There will often be times when a money manager is beginning to exhibit shortfalls in one or more metrics (e.g., deviation in investment process, violation of sell discipline, change in personnel), but in your opinion, does not warrant immediate termination.  However, you have to make sure that you have a documented approach to not only the investment policy and the methodology for manager selection, but also a documented approach for putting a manager on a program where you focus greater scrutiny on their progress and results.</p>
  <p>While not a comprehensive list, the following provides an example of the criteria that can be used to identify when to put a money manager on your <em>Watch List.</em></p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <div align="center"><h3>Watch List</h3></div>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li><span>A money manager&rsquo;s 3-year,      risk-adjusted return (Sortino, Alpha, and/or Sharpe ratios) falls below      the index median risk-adjusted return.</span></li>
      <li><span>Performance from stock      selection for fundamentally driven managers is declining.</span></li>
      <li><span>There is a change in the      professionals managing the portfolio.</span></li>
      <li><span>There is a significant      decrease in the product&rsquo;s assets.</span></li>
      <li><span>There is an indication the      money manager is deviating from his or her stated style and/or strategy.</span></li>
      <li><span>A money manager performs      below median for his or her peer group over a 1-, 3- and/or 5-year      cumulative period.</span></li>
      <li><span>There is an increase in      the product&rsquo;s fees and expenses.</span></li>
      <li><span>Any extraordinary event occurs that may interfere with the manager&rsquo;s ability to fulfill his or her role in the future.</span>  </li>
    </ol>
