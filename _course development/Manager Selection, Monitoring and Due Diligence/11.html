  <p>As already highlighted, performance is an important litmus test for the effectiveness of a firm&rsquo;s investment skills, as applied within their process.  Performance evaluation identifies the manager&rsquo;s ability to deliver incremental returns across a variety of market cycles, including bull markets, bear markets and other important investment cycles such as style shifts and capitalization shifts.  Most managers will be able to deliver alpha over short periods of time, or when the market tide is rewarding the types of securities their philosophical bias leads them to.  However, far fewer will be able to add incremental value with consistency regardless of the dominant trends in favor.</p>
