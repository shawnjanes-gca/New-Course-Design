  <p>Measuring the variation of a portfolio&rsquo;s rate of return is of limited use unless it is done in comparison to a benchmark. Standard Deviation measures absolute return volatility but not volatility that one would naturally expect relative to the market fluctuations that have occurred.  Wide swings in a manager&rsquo;s performance that are perfectly in sync with a volatile market might indicate that the manager is no riskier than the market as a whole, while wide price swings on an investment manager&rsquo;s performance during a stable market might indicate that the manager is significantly riskier than the market as a whole. This movement of a manager&rsquo;s return relative to the movement of the market can be statistically measured and is called <strong><em>covariance</em></strong>. Stated differently, <strong><em>covariance measures the extent of mutual variation between any two variables</em></strong>.   In this case, the two variables are the manager&rsquo;s portfolio and the general market index.</p>
  <p>The Capital Asset Pricing Model uses a concept known as <strong><em>beta (ß)</em></strong> to measure the covariance between a stock and the market. In other words, <strong><em>beta (ß)</em></strong> is a measure of how a stock or portfolio moves relative to movements in the market. If the beta of each stock in a portfolio is known, then the beta of a portfolio can be easily determined by calculating a weighted average of the betas of all the stocks in the portfolio. In this manner, beta can be used to speak of the risk of a stock or a portfolio relative to the market.</p>
  <p>A high beta means that the portfolio is riskier than the market as a whole; a low beta means it is less risky than the market. If a security moves perfectly in sync with market movements (in the same direction and to the same degree), then it has a beta coefficient of 1.0.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Beta coefficients below 1.0 indicate that a stock or portfolio is less risky than the market as a whole. Thus, the risk premium is less than that of the market. When the market rises, the stock (portfolio) will not be expected to rise as much; when the market declines, the stock (portfolio) will be expected to decline to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stock with a beta coefficient of 1.0 has the same coefficient as the market as a whole, thus it is expected to behave perfectly in sync with the market. Thus, its risk premium is equal to that of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta coefficients above 1.0 indicate that the stock or portfolio is more risky than the market as a whole. Thus, its risk premium is greater than that of the market. When the market rises, the stock (portfolio) will be expected to rise even more; when the market declines, the stock (portfolio) will be expected to decline even further.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 2em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the risk premium (the rate above the risk-free rate) for the market is 8%, a stock with a beta of 1.5 would have a risk premium of 1.5 x 8% = 12%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
