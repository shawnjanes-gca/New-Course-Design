  <p>The investment philosophy is the underlying investment beliefs that guide the manager&rsquo;s investment discipline.  As you analyze an investment discipline, you want to find a firm that has a clearly articulated philosophy that is the basis for how they deliver added value through their investment approach.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>How to Evaluate</h3>
    <p>Philosophy is another area of very subjective evaluation and is difficult to analyze within a structured framework.  Your analysis should focus on the ability of the manager to articulate their specific investment biases and the rationale they have for adding value in efficient investment markets.  They should be able to discuss and show historical significance relating to how they can deliver incremental investment returns. </p>
    <p>Examples of a firm&rsquo;s investment philosophy could be as simple as their focus on a specific investment style, such as &ldquo;large cap value,&rdquo; but should be even more detailed.  To use the value manager as an example, further detail around their investment philosophy could include details that formed the rationale for their focus on value stocks, such as the historical out-performance of low P/E stocks.</p>
    <h3>What you are looking for:</h3>
    <p>When reviewing a firm&rsquo;s philosophy statement, you want to find managers that not only can effectively articulate the basis for their investment approach, but also firms that have a creative perspective on how they can exploit market inefficiencies in an effort to deliver incremental returns above the benchmark.</p>
