<p>Once the optimal portfolio has been designed and the investment policy statement prepared and implemented, the final critical step is the ongoing monitoring and supervision of the investment process. The monitoring function extends beyond a strict examination of performance; by definition, monitoring occurs across all policy and procedural issues previously addressed in this program.</p>
<p>A long-term investment strategy requires alteration only when the underlying factors of the investment objectives change. Changes to the long-term investment approach are best made when one of the following client factors change. To make this easy to remember, we use the acronym <em><strong>TREAT</strong></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>T</strong> ax status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>R</strong> isk tolerance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E</strong> xpected return</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong> sset class preferences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T</strong> ime horizon</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that changes to TREAT tend to be infrequent, if not rare. You should work carefully with your clients to ensure that the ongoing reviews of their situation do not turn into reviews directed toward constantly reassessing existing policy. Clients should be consistently educated to maintain focus on the longer term nature of the investment markets and the Investment Policy that is in place and not become overly and unnecessarily emotional about market variations that will invariably occur. Constant changes in investment policy not associated with changes in the client's situation tend to not only be counterproductive; they can also cause damage to long-term portfolio performance potential.</p>
