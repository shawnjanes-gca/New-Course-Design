<p>In almost every case, investment decisions that have been made through careful screening and analysis will not encounter immediate, unforeseen circumstances requiring rapid change. While managers will certainly experience periods where their process is a bit out of favor and performance wanes, there should be defined protocols for identifying managers who are placed on the Watch List, notified of the action, and then tracked more closely over the following periods. The role of the fiduciary is to have a specific framework for monitoring the managers and their performance over time in order to protect the best interests of your clients. In addition to performance, there are other variables as well that should be continually used in the ongoing scrutiny of a manager.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the decision to retain or terminate a manager cannot be made by a formula or black box. It is the fiduciary's confidence in the money manager's ability to perform in the future that ultimately determines the retention of a money manager.</p>
