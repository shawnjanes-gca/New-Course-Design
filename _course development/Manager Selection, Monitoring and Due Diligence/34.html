  <p>In keeping with the duty of prudence, a fiduciary appointing a money manager (or selecting a mutual fund) must determine the frequency of the reviews necessary, taking into account such factors as:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><span>The general economic conditions then prevailing;</span></li>
    <li><span>The size of the portfolio;</span></li>
    <li><span>The investment strategies employed;</span></li>
    <li><span>The investment objectives sought; and</span></li>
    <li><span>The volatility of the investments selected.</span></li>
  </ol>
<p>Some degree of informal monitoring should take place between the scheduled monitoring meetings so that immediate action can be taken when there are extreme or sudden deviations from the performance objectives established in the investment policy statement.</p>
