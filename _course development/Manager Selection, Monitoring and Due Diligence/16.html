<p>When reviewing the manager's performance, it is important to look at more than simply absolute returns, or returns versus an index. In either case, the risk profile of the manager is not taken into consideration. It might be that over the short term a manager is delivering returns above the benchmark, but has done so by straying outside their investment mandate, thereby causing the overall client portfolio to be put at greater risk. Or, the manager might have delivered returns by taking on excessive levels of risk exposure which could be detrimental to the portfolio in the future.</p>
<p>To make a full analysis of performance statistics, you will need to utilize other tools that help quantify risk exposure relative to the performance generated. In either case, there are tools and calculations that can be used to provide attribution of the manager's returns to their investment tendencies during the period.</p>
<p>Attribution analysis can quickly become quite mathematically complex. The intention of this course is not to delve into these topics in depth, but we will next look at some more sophisticated performance evaluation methods that will help provide you greater insights into a manager's performance record. First, let's look at how risk can be quantified.</p>
