<blockquote>
<p>An effective monitoring program should provide the fiduciary with sufficient information to evaluate the investment program's strengths and weaknesses, and to keep the program on track in achieving investment objectives. The establishment of appropriate performance measurement objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Facilitates effective communications between all parties involved in determining the continued appropriateness of the investment policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitates the evaluation of the asset allocation strategy as directed by the investment policy statement with respect to the portfolio's risk tolerance and modeled return expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitates effective communications between the fiduciary, service providers, and money managers and helps to confirm mutually agreed-upon goals and objectives of the investment policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports the qualitative judgment about the continued confidence, or lack of it, in the money manager's abilities.</p>
</li>
</ol></blockquote>
