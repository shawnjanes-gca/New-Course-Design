  <p>The fees and expenses of the investment strategy have a significant impact on the actual results that your client will experience.  As such, evaluation of the fees and total expenses associated with the management of the portfolio are vital to fulfilling your role as a fiduciary.</p>

    <h3>How to Evaluate</h3>
    <p>Evaluation of the total fees requires that you review the management fees, as well as all other fees such as trading expenses, custody fees and 12b-1 fees (should the vehicle be a mutual fund).  While it is not a requirement that you always obtain the lowest fees, the fees must be deemed appropriate.  Typically, you can consider fees to be appropriate when they are no greater than the top quartile relative to other managers.</p>
