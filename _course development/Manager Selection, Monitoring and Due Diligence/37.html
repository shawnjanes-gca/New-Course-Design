<p>As discussed in earlier sections of the course, performance measurement is not the only role the fiduciary has to play. It is also important to provide ongoing evaluation of the performance being generated by the manager as well.</p>
<p>While performance evaluation on an ongoing basis should be no different from the performance evaluation done in the due diligence and selection process, there are other powerful, and often used tools available that can help provide perspective and clarity as to the returns a manager is delivering to your client. In particular, the style consistency and ongoing correlation of the returns to the manager's benchmark are important considerations. Of course, these are in addition to the other forms of performance evaluation already discussed in the first section.</p>
