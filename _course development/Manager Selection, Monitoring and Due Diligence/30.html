  <p>As you have seen, performance analysis can be either relatively simplistic or can become very complex.  The key is to ensure that you do more than a simplistic comparison of returns over a given period or series of periods when selecting managers.  You must pay close attention to the sources of the returns generated.  Using the approaches and calculations that have been discussed in this section of the course can help to provide a framework for you to conduct an effective review of a manager&rsquo;s historical returns.</p>
