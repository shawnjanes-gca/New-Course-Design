  </h1>
  <p>While style analysis is generally accepted as an effective tool for understanding how a manager is investing a portfolio, there are some differences of opinion on how style analysis should be done.  There are two primary approaches to style analysis: the returns-based and the holdings-based.</p>

              <p>Returns-based style analysis compares the portfolio&rsquo;s historical returns to the returns of various indexes over an identical time period.  The approach is a mathematical regression seeking to explain the portfolio returns by establishing correlations between the actual returns of the portfolio and a series of benchmark indices representing the broad array of asset class exposures that could be used.   Inferences about the manager&rsquo;s style can be based on how closely the portfolio returns resemble those of the various different indexes.</p>
              <p>In the seminal work on investment styles,1 Nobel Laureate William Sharpe established a multi-factor regression model using a variety of investment indices to track the performance generated across the global markets.  This regression approach was further refined and presented in a later publication in the Journal of Portfolio Management where a 12 factor model was used. 2 By doing regression analysis, Sharpe was able to infer specific style exposures or style bets being made in a portfolio.  While not 100% accurate, it was an approach that intended to provide greater insights into the exposures and tendencies of an active manager.</p>

              <p>Holdings-based style analysis <u>and</u> attribution is a more sophisticated, and much more mathematically complex, approach to performance analysis.  In this methodology, a manager&rsquo;s portfolio is classified based on the specific characteristics of the actual securities held in the portfolio.  Many believe that this is the most effective and accurate approach to understanding the exact style of a manager.  However, it can be very difficult to perform holdings-based analysis as it requires that you have access to the actual holdings of the manager at numerous points in time in order to make appropriate comparisons.</p>
              <p>While it is argued that returns-based style analysis is not as accurate as is a holdings-based approach, it is a more common form of style analysis primarily because the data required to make the assessment is more readily available.</p>
