  <p>Trust agreements are typically written agreements, drafted by attorneys. These agreements are extraordinarily flexible, and can be tailored for virtually any purpose.</p>
  <p>They may be revocable; meaning the person who created the trust can alter or cancel it at any time. Or they may be irrevocable, meaning they cannot be altered or canceled after their creation.</p>
  <p>They may be created during life, which is known as a living trust, or by a person's will, which is known as a testamentary trust.Â  Note that since the grantor is dead when a testamentary trust is funded, it is by its very nature irrevocable.</p>
  <p>They may bind the trustee to do only what the trustee is explicitly directed to do by the grantor or the terms of the trust, which is called a non-discretionary trust. Or they may allow the trustee to use his or her own discretion in deciding what investment changes to make and/or how to distribute income or principal to the beneficiaries, which is known as a discretionary trust.</p>
