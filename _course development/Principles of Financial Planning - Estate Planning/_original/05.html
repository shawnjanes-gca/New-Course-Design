<p>A will also allows you to select the person or institution that will be empowered by the court to settle your estate. Depending upon the state, this person who is designated to settle the estate is referred to as the <a onmouseover="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" onmouseout="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">executor</span></a> or personal representative, and the court that has jurisdiction over the proceeding is referred to as the probate(adj.) court (in some jurisdictions, it may be referred to as the surrogate court).</p>
<p>The process of settling an estate through the court is referred to as probate<em> (n.)</em>, and to go through that process is to probate<em> (v.)</em> the estate. That this is done as a court-monitored process reflects the fact that the will is viewed as a legally enforceable document, the instructions of which are binding upon the personal representative. Being a legal document, it should be drafted by an attorney.</p>

<p>While it may be viewed as an honor to be named as someone's executor, it can be a difficult and time-consuming task. There is the further potential that the executor may be placed in the middle of a family squabble over the estate, which is particularly troubling if the executor is a family member.</p>
<p>There is also financial risk for the executor. If the executor fails to act in a prudent manner and is found to have been negligent, then the executor may be personally liable for the damages. In other words, the executor may end up paying for the privilege of settling the estate.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is wise to consider a corporate executor. With a corporate executor, the testator is further assured of professional expertise and impartiality in the handling of the estate.</p>
