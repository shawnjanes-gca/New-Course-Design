<h3><a id="p7ABt1_1" href="javascript:;"><strong>Annual Exclusion Gifts</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>For 2016, the annual gift tax exclusion amount is $14,000. Thus, the first $14,000 gifted to any person is covered by this exclusion amount. Spouses can do &ldquo;split&rdquo; gifts, doubling the amount to $28,000. What is more, there is an equivalent exclusion available for the Generation- Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax, making it possible to make annual exclusion gifts to grandchildren (or other skip persons).</p>
<p>For example, a couple with three children and 7 grandchildren could gift $280,000, free of transfer taxes. Do that for a number of years, and a client can significantly cut into a large estate&rsquo;s tax liability.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Further reductions in the size of the taxable estate can be made by paying medical and tuition expenses on behalf of others. These payments must be made directly to the provider.</p>
<p>These gifts are totally independent of annual exclusion gifts. Both an annual exclusion gift AND a tuition payment AND/OR medical payment can be made for the same person, and none of them are taxable gifts.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" href="javascript:;"><strong>529 Plans</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>529 Savings Plans are excellent vehicles for saving for a child&rsquo;s education. Not only does a 529 Plan qualify for annual exclusion gifts on behalf of the child or grandchild, but it also allows for accelerated gifting. Up to 5 years worth of annual exclusion gifts can be contributed at one time as a lump sum without triggering a Gift or GST Tax. One caveat to making this election is if total contributions to each beneficiary exceeds five times the annual gift tax exclusion, the excess amount is treated as a taxable gift in the year of contribution.</p>
