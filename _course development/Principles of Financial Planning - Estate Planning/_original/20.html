<p>This is the beginning point; it is as close to automatic as one can get. The only planning required to benefit from this resource is to be born. Each person is given a credit against transfer taxes, known as the Applicable Credit Amount, which offsets the tax that would otherwise be due on taxable transfers. The amount of transferred assets protected by the credit is known as the Applicable Exclusion Amount. In other words, the Applicable Exclusion Amount tells how much a person can transfer, which would otherwise be subject to transfer tax, without having to pay a tax.</p>

<h4>Estate Tax Applicable Exclusion Amount</h4>
<p>The 2001 Tax Relief Act began increasing the Applicable Exclusion Amount for estates from $675,000 in 2001 to $3,500,000 in 2009. All assets in the estate were allowed to step-up their tax basis to the date of death value or the value at the alternate valuation date (6 months after death), whichever was used on the estate tax return. For 2010, the estate tax was repealed, but a limit was imposed on the amount by which the tax basis of estate assets could be stepped up in value.</p>
<p>Then came the 2010 Tax Relief Act, which reinstated the estate tax for 2010. The default position was to grant a $5,000,000 estate tax exclusion and an unrestricted step-up in basis; alternatively, the Act allowed the executor to opt for the arrangement formerly called for under the Tax Relief Act of 2001, whereby for 2010 there was no estate tax but a limitation on the amount by which the tax basis of assets could be stepped up. In selecting between these two options, the choice resulting in the most favorable tax treatment essentially depended upon the size and the tax basis of the estate assets; thus, the choice between the two options had to be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The 2010 Tax Relief Act further increased the Applicable Exclusion amount to $5,000,000 for 2011 and $5,120,000 ($5,000,000 plus an inflation adjustment) for 2012. Here, too, a full step-up in basis was allowed. This Act also introduced the portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount, whereby the surviving spouse can inherit the &ldquo;Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion&rdquo; (DSUE) Amount for use in his/her own estate. Thus, the Applicable Exclusion Amount for the surviving spouse becomes his/her own &ldquo;Basic Exclusion Amount&rdquo; plus the DSUE Amount.</p>
<p>Then came the 2012 Tax Relief Act. The 2012 Tax Relief Act extended the $5,000,000 Applicable Exclusion Amount, adjusted for inflation, to 2013 and beyond ($5,430,000 for 2015) and made the portability of the Exclusion Amount permanent. However, it also raised the maximum tax rate on the transfer tax rate schedule to 40%.</p>

<h4>Gift Tax Exclusion Amount</h4>
<p>Under the Tax Relief Act of 2001, the full Applicable Exclusion Amount was available for lifetime gifts through 2003. For 2004-2009, the portion that could be excluded for lifetime cumulative gifts was capped at $1,000,000 (excluding spousal transfers, charitable gifts, annual exclusion gifts, and payment of tuition or health care). In 2010, when the estate tax was repealed, the Gift Tax was NOT REPEALED; it remained in place with a $1,000,000 lifetime exclusion.</p>
<p>Then came the Tax Relief Act of 2010. As we shall discuss later, under the Tax Relief Act of 2010, the full amount of the Applicable Exclusion Amount again became available in 2011 and 2012 for cumulative lifetime gifts. The 2012 Tax Relief Act extended this to 2013 and beyond.</p>
