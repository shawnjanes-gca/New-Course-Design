<p>This concludes the material for this subject. At this time you may return to any sections in which you feel the need for further study. As you do so, keep in mind that your role as a financial advisor is not to give estate planning advice. Rather, your role is to gather information from clients regarding their financial assets, personal concerns, and personal goals. From this information, you can draw upon your knowledge, or work with other professionals on your team, to identify potential client needs. You can then assist your client in addressing those needs with estate planning professionals.</p>
<p>In other words, your primary role in the area of estate planning is to ask questions and to listen. What questions? As you go back through this material, you will recognize many areas where clients might have potential needs or where there may strategies to help them achieve their goals. As you encounter these areas, ask yourself, "What questions will I ask to surface whether or not this need exists?" Over time, you will develop your own list, but to help you get started, here are some initial areas to explore:</p>
