<h2>Planning for Larger Estates of Married Couples Before the Advent of Portability</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s now examine a pre-portability example of a larger estate to learn some additional techniques that were widely utilized in conjunction with the Credit Shelter Trust prior to the advent of portability, but which have continued utility for today.</p>

<p><strong>Example of Mr. and Mrs. Dollar (2009)</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, John and Susan Dollar, both U.S. citizens, were both in their 70's. John was in poor health and was concerned that he might predecease Susan, who has never handled any of the financial affairs, and he feared she would be overwhelmed by having to handle things herself. They had four grown children, all of whom were married with children of their own. Their youngest son had recently been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease), and John and Susan Dollar were providing financial assistance to him and his family.</p>
<p>John and Susan's combined estate was currently valued at $9.5 million. Each had an Applicable Exclusion Amount in 2009 of $3.5 million. How might they plan to minimize their estate tax exposure?* The following is how this was typically done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Split Assets</strong></p>
<p>Since they could not predict which would die first, they would typically divide up assets, making sure that each spouse could use as much of their Applicable Exclusion Amount as possible upon the first death. In our example, let&rsquo;s assume that John and Susan divide assets equally, with each spouse owning $4.75 million each.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create a Credit Shelter Trust Upon the First Death</strong></p>
<p>Assuming the first spouse died in 2009 when the Applicable Exclusion Amount was $3.5 million, then $3.5 million would go into the Credit Shelter Trust upon the first death.</p>
<p><strong>3. Transfer Remaining Assets to the Surviving Spouse</strong></p>
<p>After funding the Credit Shelter Trust, the first estate has a taxable balance of $1.25 million. Rather than pay taxes in the first estate, the taxes could be deferred by passing them on to the surviving spouse through use of the unlimited marital deduction. This would provide the surviving spouse time to do additional tax planning to reduce the size of the taxable estate, which we shall discuss, prior to the assets being taxed upon the second spouse&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>While&nbsp; transferring the remaining assets to the surviving spouse would defer taxation, many clients preferred not to transfer assets outright in the hands of a surviving spouse. This could be because the surviving spouse was not familiar with handling assets and the client did not want to burden the surviving spouse. Alternatively, this might be a second marriage and, while the client wished to adequately support the surviving spouse, there was also the desire to assure that the assets went to the deceased&rsquo;s own children from a prior marriage. So, how does one defer taxation of assets that exceed what can placed in the Credit Shelter Trust by utilizing the unlimited marital deduction, yet not make an outright transfer to the surviving spouse?</p>
<p><strong>3. (Alternative) &ndash; Transfer Assets to a Marital Trust</strong></p>
<p>The answer that was commonly deployed was to utilize a <strong><em>Marital Trust</em></strong>. This was typically referred to as A-B Trust planning, whereby a Credit Shelter Trust was set up for the Family (the A trust) and a Marital Trust (the B Trust) would be set up for the benefit of the surviving spouse.</p>
<p>The terms of the marital trust would be such that the assets would be included in the surviving spouse&rsquo;s estate, thereby qualifying the trust for the unlimited marital deduction. In this manner, taxation of the marital trust would be deferred until the second death, just as occurred with an outright transfer to the surviving spouse.</p>
<p>Two types of marital trusts were commonly used: the <strong>General Power of Appointment (POA) Marital Trust</strong> and the <strong>Qualified Terminal Interest Property (QTIP) Marital Trust</strong>. Both continue to have utility today for those situations where the preference is NOT to leave assets outright to the surviving spouse. We will discuss each type on the following pages.</p>
