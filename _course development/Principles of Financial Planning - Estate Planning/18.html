<p>Generally speaking, every adult needs to consider having certain estate planning documents in place. Failure to do so can significantly jeapordize personal goals, expose survivors to unnecessary risk, and, for large estates, may result in higher transfer taxes. Key documents that everyone should consider are listed below. While other documents may be employed in the estate plan to accomplish specific goals, such as trusts that are established while a person is alive, the following list should be considered by everyone: <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click each document to learn more.</strong></p>

<p>Unless they are prepared to have their assets distribute in accordance with state statutes, everyone needs a will to direct distribution of assets upon death.&nbsp; Wills are also useful when desiring to set up testamernary trusts to provide benefits for survivors. We have already discussed some of the uses and benefits of trusts, but will have more to say on the use of trusts in estate planning in the pages that follow.</p>
<p>Generally, for married couples, it is very important to coordinate the couples wills (in fact, to coordinate their entire estate plans) to assure that they work together to achieve established goals, particularly since it is impossible to predict which spouse might die first.</p>

<p>A Durable Power of Attorney is a document that allows you to appoint another person or persons to manage your affairs and make financial decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated. It is important to include a durability provision to have these powers continue if you become incapacitated or mentally incompetent, otherwise, its powers will cease.</p>
<p>The powers given may be either &ldquo;general&rdquo; or &ldquo;special&rdquo; (aka, &ldquo;limited&rdquo;). If &ldquo;general,&rdquo; your chosen attorney has extensive powers over your affaits; &nbsp;a &ldquo;special&rdquo; power of attorney is limited to specifically defined tasks.</p>

<p>A Living Will allows you to state your wishes about certain types of medical care and life prolonging procedures. The document only takes effect if you cannot communicate your own health care decisions. The benefit of a Living Will is that you do not put your family in the position of having to make difficult decisions and you also ensure your health care wishes are carried out.</p>

<p>A Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (health care proxy) is a document that lets you appoint another person to make medical decisions on your behalf if you become unable to make those decisions yourself. This document may resolve any potential conflicts over your medical treatment, and helps ensure your wishes are respected. Unlike a Living Will, this document covers a broad range of health care decisions.</p>
