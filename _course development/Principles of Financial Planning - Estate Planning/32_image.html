  <p>If a person has charitable intent, then that person can also make charitable gifts. These gifts are not subject to gift taxes and, obviously, they reduce the size of the donor&rsquo;s estate. </p>
  <p>While gifts can be made directly to the charity, it is also possible to establish and fund a Charitable Trust, with a charity as the beneficiary. This can be created in either of two primary forms: a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) or a Charitable Lead Trusts (CLT). These can provide significant benefits beyond making direct gifts to charities, and we will discuss each in turn.</p>
  <p>The <strong><em>Charitable Remainder Trust</em></strong> <strong><em>(CRT)</em></strong> provides current income to the creator of the trust, the grantor, and future benefit to the charitable beneficiary. Here is how a charitable remainder trust works, based on sample trusts that have been issued by the IRS to guide attorneys in drafting charitable remainder trusts that will qualify for the income tax charitable deduction. These trusts are characterized by the following:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>The trust can provide income      for one or more beneficiaries. Generally, only the grantor or the grantor      and his/her spouse are named as the income beneficiaries, so as to avoid      transfer tax issues associated with naming anyone else.</li>
    <li>The trust can be written to      terminate upon the death of the income beneficiary or upon their combined      deaths if more than one. Alternatively, the trust can be written to      terminate at the end of a specific number of years, not to exceed 20      years. </li>
    <li>Income distributions to the      beneficiary(ies) can begin immediately or may be deferred to begin at a      future date. </li>
    <li>The trust may be drafted so      that the charitable beneficiary designation can be changed without losing      the tax advantages of the trust, as long as the change is to another      qualified charity.</li>
    <li>The annual payout to the income beneficiary(ies) cannot be less than 5% or more than 50% of the value of the trust.</li>
  </ol>
