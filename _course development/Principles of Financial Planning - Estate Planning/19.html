 <h3>Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount Summary</h3>
 <ul type="disc">
        <li>The Applicable Exclusion Amount is the estate value that is offset by the Applicable Credit Amount, which is a credit against the gift and estate tax.</li>
        <li>The Applicable Exclusion Amount, which is adjusted annually for inflation, is $5,450,000 in 2016, and assets beyond that amount will be taxed at 40%. </li>
        <li>While in prior years, the portion of the Applicable Exclusion Amount that could be applied to lifetime gifts was capped at $1,000,000, beginning in 2011 this &ldquo;cap&rdquo; was removed. Today, the entire 2016 Applicable Exclusion Amount of $5,450,000 can be used for lifetime gifts.</li>
        <li>Beginning in 2011, portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount between spouses is allowed, making it possible for a surviving spouse to inherit any unused portion of the deceased spouse&rsquo;s Applicable Exclusion Amount. Previously, such inheritance was not possible and any portion that remained unused by a deceased spouse&rsquo;s estate was forfeited. Thus, a surviving spouse can now add to his/her Basic Exclusion Amount the Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE) Amount.</li>
      </ul>

<p>This is the beginning point; it is as close to automatic as one can get. The only planning required to benefit from this resource is to be born. Each person is given a credit against transfer taxes, known as the Applicable Credit Amount, which offsets the tax that would otherwise be due on taxable transfers. The amount of transferred assets protected by the credit is known as the Applicable Exclusion Amount. In other words, the Applicable Exclusion Amount tells how much a person can transfer, which would otherwise be subject to transfer tax, without having to pay a tax.</p>
