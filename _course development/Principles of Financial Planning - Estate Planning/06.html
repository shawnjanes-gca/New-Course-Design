  <p>Probate is the process whereby the court establishes the validity of a will and monitors the procedure for settling the estate. It begins the moment the will is delivered to the court and a petition for probate of the will is filed. If there is no will, someone must come forward (usually a family member) and ask that someone be appointed to settle the estate.</p>
  <p>Once appointed by the probate court (which has jurisdiction for estates, trusts, and guardianships), the executor has numerous obligations.</p>

    <p><strong>Executor Obligations</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Gather and safeguard assets. </li>
      <li>Value the assets. These may be valued as of the date of death, or the alternate valuation date of 6 months after death may be used if this results in reduced estate taxes. </li>
      <li>Publish notice to creditors to submit claims. </li>
      <li>Settle claims filed against the estate, which may include actions that were pending at the time of the decedent's death. </li>
      <li>File the decedent's final income tax return and the estate tax return, paying any taxes that are due. </li>
      <li>Pay expenses of administration. </li>
      <li>Distribute assets to heirs and/or trusts. </li>
      <li>Provide final accounting to the court.  </li>
    </ul>

  <p>In settling the estate, the executor must function as a fiduciary<!-- Create tooltip -->. As such, a fiduciary must act prudently in handling the property, and is bound by the terms of the document that establishes this responsibility, which in this case is the will.</p>
  <p>One of the values of the probate process is that it provides a venue in which claims can be filed against the estate, as well as a forum in which objections may be entered. If the executor denies a creditor's claim, there is a limited time for the creditor to file an objection with the court. Typically, failure to do so will bar the creditor from later trying to seek reimbursement from the heirs. The fact that the court will rule on objections that arise, even objections to the executors conduct or fees, serves to expedite the entire process and make it possible to close the book on all open issues with the closing of the probate process.</p>
