  <p>The Probate Estate and Taxable Estate are not the same thing. The Taxable Estate includes everything that is in the Probate Estate, and then some. Whereas the Probate Estate includes only those assets that are transferred through the will, the Taxable Estate also includes those assets that are transferred outside of the will.</p>
  <p>The following are some common examples of assets that are included in the Taxable Estate but are not included in the Probate Estate.</p>

              <p>A trust agreement is a legal document by which assets are transferred to a trustee who is charged with the responsibility of managing the assets for the benefit of designated beneficiaries. A revocable trust is one that is created while the individual was still alive, and over which he/she had the power to revoke (terminate) it.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Since the trust document governs the assets, the assets would only be part of probate if the trust paid them out to the deceased's estate, which is rare. This is not to be confused with testamentary trusts, which are part of probate because testamentary trusts are created by the will and funded with assets that are probated by the will.</p>
