By making such an assignment, the insured will forever surrender all the rights of ownership regarding the policy, and retain no incidents of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In making the transfer, the insured is gifting the current value of the policy, and the annual gift tax exclusion can be applied against the gift. Fortunately, the current value is typically small in comparison to the face amount of the policy, but it may be larger than can be covered by the annual gift tax exclusion. In that case, a gift tax return must be filed and it would be necessary to use part of the insured's applicable credit amount in the return to avoid paying a transfer tax. But that might be a small price to pay to get the appreciation out of the estate.&lt;/p&gt;" >

If the IRS were to freely allow such transfers, it would quickly become common practice for people to make deathbed assignments of insurance in anticipation of their deaths. Therefore IRS imposes a three-year rule on the transfer of insurance policies, directing that any insurance policy that is transferred by the insured within three years of death will be brought back into the insured's estate.&lt;/p&gt;" >
