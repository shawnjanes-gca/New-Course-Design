  <p>What happens when a person dies <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intestate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Having died without a will.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">intestate</a>?<!-- Create tooltip --> Essentially, state law will decide how assets are distributed. These statutes vary from state to state, but there is typically some split of assets between the spouse and the children. If there is no surviving spouse or children, then the assets typically go to the parents, then brothers and sisters, then cousins and nephews, etc.</p>
  <p>Note: In <a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_2" class="p7TTM_trg" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;community property&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Generally, community property consists of income earned while married and property purchased with such earnings. Upon death, 50% of community property is included in the deceased spouse’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;">community property</a> states (e.g., Alaska (optional), Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), community property goes to the surviving spouse, with the remaining <a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_3" class="p7TTM_trg" title="&lt;p&gt;Generally, separate property is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Property that an individual acquired prior to marriage &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A gift or inheritance specifically given to an individual spouse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compensation for personal injuries of an individual spouse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individually owned property acquired prior to moving to a community property state &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;"> separate property</a> owned by the deceased passing by state law in a manner similar to all other states.</p>
  <p>While these statutes are equitable, taking into consideration the interests of both the spouse and children, they rarely accomplish what the decedent would have preferred.</p>

    <p>The diagram on the right illustrates what happens in most states when a person dies without a will and is survived by a spouse and children.</p>
    <p>If survived by a spouse and children, most states split the assets between the surviving spouse and the children, with the spouse receiving 1/3 or 1/2 of the assets. This is true regardless of the age of the children.</p>
    <p>Note:  In community property states, such distributions would only pertain to separately owned property, since all community property would go to the surviving spouse.</p>

              <p>Because minor children cannot own property, their inheritance may require the appointment of a guardian to handle the property. While the property is administered in a guardianship, accountings to the court may be required and court approval may be needed for the sale of assets or their use on behalf of the children. Alternative planning that does not involve a court-monitored guardianship is typically preferred.</p>

              <p>Once the children become of age, which in most states is 18 years of age, the guardianship would terminate and the assets would be turned over to them. Even if the legal age was 21, most parents would prefer for children at this age to not receive their full inheritance, particularly if it is sizeable. Often times, the child has not yet learned to handle money responsibly, and might make choices (like deciding not to attend college) that would be counter to the parents' wishes.</p>
