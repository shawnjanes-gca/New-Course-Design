  <p>If a person has charitable intent, then that person can also make charitable gifts. These gifts are not subject to gift taxes and, obviously, they reduce the size of the donor&rsquo;s estate. </p>
  <p>While gifts can be made directly to the charity, it is also possible to establish and fund a Charitable Trust, with a charity as the beneficiary. This can be created in either of two primary forms: a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) or a Charitable Lead Trusts (CLT). These can provide significant benefits beyond making direct gifts to charities, and we will discuss each in turn.</p>
  <p>The <strong><em>Charitable Remainder Trust</em></strong> <strong><em>(CRT)</em></strong> provides current income to the creator of the trust, the grantor, and future benefit to the charitable beneficiary. Here is how a charitable remainder trust works, based on sample trusts that have been issued by the IRS to guide attorneys in drafting charitable remainder trusts that will qualify for the income tax charitable deduction. These trusts are characterized by the following:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><span>The trust can provide income      for one or more beneficiaries. Generally, only the grantor or the grantor      and his/her spouse are named as the income beneficiaries, so as to avoid      transfer tax issues associated with naming anyone else.</span></li>
    <li><span>The trust can be written to      terminate upon the death of the income beneficiary or upon their combined      deaths if more than one. Alternatively, the trust can be written to      terminate at the end of a specific number of years, not to exceed 20      years.</span></li>
    <li><span>Income distributions to the      beneficiary(ies) can begin immediately or may be deferred to begin at a      future date. </span></li>
    <li><span>The trust may be drafted so      that the charitable beneficiary designation can be changed without losing      the tax advantages of the trust, as long as the change is to another      qualified charity.</span></li>
    <li><span>The annual payout to the income beneficiary(ies) cannot be less than 5% or more than 50% of the value of the trust.</span></li>
  </ol>

Generally speaking, appreciated property should be given first priority. This is because no capital gain taxes are payable when the property is donated. If the trust later sells the asset, again there are no capital gain taxes. Only if the capital gain gets paid out to the income beneficiary would the beneficiary be subject to the tax. As long as there is sufficient ordinary income to cover the payout requirements, the capital gains generated in the trust will remain in the trust until final distribution to the charity. This will provide the advantage of making the contribution at FMV without having to pay taxes on the gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the deductible value of the contributed property must be at least 10% of its value; anything less will prevent the trust from qualifying as a charitable remainder trust.&lt;/p&gt;">

The tables that are used to calculate the amount that may be deducted will take into account the number of years before termination and distributions to the donor. If the trust is for the lifetime of the income beneficiary(ies), the tables will also take into consideration life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;" >

The income calculation can be structured as an annuity, based on the initial valuation of the trust (a Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust or CRAT) or the calculation can be computed annually based on the market value in each successive year (a Charitable Remainder Unitrust or CRUT).&lt;/p&gt;" >

This amount may be more or less than was originally contributed, depending upon investment performance and the degree to which income was allowed to accumulate and principal was not encroached to make required payments to the income beneficiary. &lt;/p&gt;" >
