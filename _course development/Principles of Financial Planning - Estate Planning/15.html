<p>Unlike brokerage accounts and investment management accounts, which may terminate upon being notified of the incapacity of the account owner, trusts continue. This enables the trustee to continue managing the assets for the benefit of a grantor, following the grantor's dictates, while avoiding the need to involve the court in a guardianship.</p>

<h3><strong>Sarah's Story</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>Sarah Henderson is an 80-year-old widow who lives in South Florida, which is almost a thousand miles away from her children. She is currently in good health and is fiercely independent. She is adamant that she never wants to be placed in a nursing home, preferring to be cared for at home so long as her assets make this possible. She is equally insistent that she never wants to be a burden to her children. Therefore, Sarah appointed a corporate bank to act as the trustee of a revocable living trust. As a revocable trust, Sarah retains full control over the assets while she is alive and competent, directing the trustee to make distributions to her as she needs them. In case she becomes unable to handle her own affairs, the trust document instructs the trustee to apply the funds toward maintaining her in her home, so long as there are sufficient assets to make this possible. Upon her death, the trust terminates and the remaining assets are distributed to her children.</p>

<h3><strong>The Stephens</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>Tom and Elizabeth Stephens are both in their seventies. Tom has always handled the investments and Elizabeth feels uncomfortable handling any financial matters beyond her checking account and credit cards. Knowing that men typically have shorter life spans than women, Tom decided to put a plan in place to provide security and peace of mind for his wife in the event that he predeceases her. Tom accomplished this by transferring his assets into a living trust and appointing a corporate trustee. This gives Tom an opportunity to evaluate the skills of the trustee while he is alive and thereby to reassure his wife that she will be in good hands if he should die before her.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" href="javascript:;"><strong>Protection for Minor Beneficiaries</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The use of a trust should be considered whenever a minor child is involved. Without a trust, a child will receive access to an inheritance upon reaching the age of majority, which is age eighteen in most states. Since no one can predict the child's level of maturity at that age, there is inherent risk in having a plan that leaves everything to a child at such a young age. Will the newfound funds be squandered on a spending spree? Will the child feel empowered by the funds to skip college? Will the child be involved in experimentation with drugs and use the funds for that purpose?</p>
<p>By using a trust, it becomes possible to defer some or all of the funds until the child is older. Typically, this is done in installments, thereby giving the child a chance to grow in responsibility. If the child fails to properly manage the money after the first distribution from trust, then at least there is a chance that the child will learn from that mistake and do better with the next one.</p>

<h3><strong>Joseph and Ruth</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>Joseph and Ruth Abrams are in their late twenties, with twin sons who are five years old. Their estate is approximately $800,000. They went to an attorney to have wills drawn so that they could name guardians in case they were to die in a common accident. The attorney suggested that their estate plan should include the funding of a trust for their minor children.</p>
<p>The attorney explained that the trust, which would be created by their will, would direct the trustee to provide funds for the care and education of the children. Upon reaching age 18, the children would begin to receive the income from the trust. At age 21, they would receive 1/3 of the assets, at age 25 they would receive &amp;frac12 of the balance, and at age 30 the trusts would terminate and the children would receive the remaining balance.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>People with "special needs," such as a physical or mental disability, are often eligible for government assistance, e.g., through Social Security and/or Medicaid. Leaving an inheritance to someone who has such a need can jeopardize the person's government assistance. Therefore, instead of transferring the funds directly to the person, a "special needs" trust can be established that names the special needs person as the beneficiary. This trust can provide assistance that goes beyond the government assistance, providing for supplemental living expenses and paying for medical assistance that might be beyond that provided by government programs.</p>

<p>Jane has an adult daughter who, because of a fall, suffers partial paralysis. The daughter currently receives government assistance. Jane would like to leave her home to her daughter so that she will always have a place to live, but fears that giving it to her daughter will jeopardize her daughter's government assistance. Instead, upon Jane's death the home will be placed in trust and the daughter will be allowed to live in the home free of rent. Additional funds will be placed in the trust to provide for its maintenance and to pay utilities. Upon the daughter's death, the home will be sold and the assets will be distributed to Jane's two other children.</p>

<p>When property is transferred via the will, the disposition of the property becomes a matter of public record. Anyone who desires to see a copy of the will can go to the courthouse and obtain one. This is often undesirable, particularly when someone is a public figure or where there is concern that there can be family strife if certain relatives learn the particulars of one's estate. One virtue of a living trust is that it is not generally covered by the will. Only those persons who are named as beneficiaries will be entitled to any specific information regarding the terms of the trust.</p>

<h3><strong>Mr. Williamson</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>Phillip Williamson has been mayor of a small country town for over twenty years. He has three grown children and over twenty close relatives who all live in the same community. He is concerned that upon his death the local newspaper might reveal information regarding his estate, particularly how he decides to divide his assets among his children and relatives.</p>
<p>To prevent this, his attorney created a revocable trust, which Phillip funded with one dollar. His attorney also created a "pour-over will," which "pours" Mr. Williamson's entire estate over into the trust upon his death. The trust will contain all the information as to how assets are to be used for or distributed to his three children. All anyone will be able to learn by going to the courthouse is that his will distributed everything to his trust, the terms of which remain private.</p>
