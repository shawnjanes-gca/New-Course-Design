                <p>The term &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; is derived from Roman law, and applies to a person or entity that has accepted a responsibility that must be performed in the best interests of another person or entity.  In other words, action cannot be based on self-interest; the interest of another must come first.</p>

                <p>As a &ldquo;relationship,&rdquo; it must be freely entered into.  Just because someone is named to assume this obligation (as trustee), does not obligate him or her to act in this capacity.  It is always possible to &ldquo;disclaim the appointment.&rdquo;  But once accepted, the responsibility is legally binding.</p>

                <p>The party acting in this fiduciary capacity is called a Trustee.  Unlike someone who has a power of attorney or someone who is acting as an agent or custodian, the trustee actually takes legal title to all property held in the trust.</p>

                <p>Trusts are created for the purpose of managing property and utilizing it for specific purposes. Without property, there is no effective trust. All too frequently people create trust documents, only to fail to properly fund them.</p>

  <p>While trusts can be created verbally, this course will only deal with trusts that are created by written agreement. Under such agreements, property is transferred only when the receiving party agrees to abide by the terms of the agreement. Generally these agreements are written by attorneys, and they are legally enforceable. If for any reason the trustee fails to properly carry out the duties, any interested party can bring legal action against the trustee.</p>
  <p>In drafting trust agreements, care must be taken to make sure there is no conflict with the will. This is important because assets owned by the trust will be administered by the terms of the trust. Unless the trust is required to distribute assets to the estate, the will has no authority over trust assets. For this reason, wills and trust agreements are customarily treated as complementary tools in estate planning.</p>
