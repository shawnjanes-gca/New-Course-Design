	<h3>Estate Tax Deductions</h3>
    	<ul>
        	<li>The amount that can be transferred to a U.S. citizen spouses without tax is unlimited.</li>
         	<li>Transfers to charities are deductible.</li>
        </ul>
  </div>
  
  <p>A quick examination of the estate tax return reveals that there are two unlimited deductions available:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The unlimited marital deduction </li>
    <li>The charitable deduction</li>
  </ul>

<p>No transfer tax is assessed against these transfers and none of the Applicable Credit/Exclusion needs to be applied on a gift tax return or estate tax return to protect these transfers from taxation.</p>
