<p>The final technique we shall discuss for reducing the size of the taxable estate is in regards to life insurance. No asset appreciates more dramatically upon death than does insurance. Since insurance is included in the owner's estate at its full face value, not the cash value that existed just before death, it is no wonder then that it is one of the first assets planners seek to exclude from estate taxation.</p>
  <p>But what must be done to exclude life insurance from one's estate?</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p>The answer is simple: Don't own it!</p>
    <p>The only requirement to exclude insurance from the estate of the insured is that someone other than the insured must own the policy.</p>
    <p>This can be accomplished with a new policy by gifting money to another person, such as an adult child, who then makes the purchase. Each year thereafter, additional gifts could be made to pay the annual premiums. As long as the annual gifts to that individual do not exceed the annual gift tax exclusion amount (double that amount for joint gifts by husband and wife), there is no tax consequence to the gifts. And as long as the insured has none of the rights associated with ownership of the policy, it will never be a part of the insured's estate. These rights are typically referred to as incidents of ownership, and include the right to name the beneficiaries, the right to borrow against the policy, and the right to cash in the policy.</p>
    <p>If a life insurance policy is already owned, gifting it to another person is a bit more complicated, as shown in the following page.</p>
