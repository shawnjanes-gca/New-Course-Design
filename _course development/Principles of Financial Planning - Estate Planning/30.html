    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Thus far, we have only discussed estate tax planning for assets that are covered by the Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount (combined amounts for spouses).Â  What about very large estates that exceed these amounts? These are estates that are large enough to actually owe an estate tax, even after full use of the Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount(s). Is there any planning that can be done to reduce that tax exposure?</p>
  <p>Actually, there is a great deal that can be done because the tax code provides numerous other resources we can leverage, such as the annual gift tax exclusion and the ability to make non-taxable transfers to charities.</p>
  <p>On the following pages, we will discuss some of these strategies, all of which aim at reducing the amount of assets that will be included in in the estate upon death. In particular, we shall discuss:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <ol>
      <li><span>Lifetime Gifting</span></li>
      <li><span>Charitable Trusts</span> </li>
      <li><span>Grantor Retained Trusts</span></li>
      <li><span>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>This list is certainly not exhaustive, but should give you a general understanding of the types of techniques that are available for reducing the tax exposure of very large estates.</p>
