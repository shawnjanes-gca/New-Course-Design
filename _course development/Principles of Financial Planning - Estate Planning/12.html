              <p>This is the person or institution that takes title to the property, agrees to be governed by the trust document, and agrees to act on behalf of the beneficiary. In fulfilling the duties, the Trustee may have as much or as little power as the grantor chose to relinquish, as stated in the terms of the agreement. Any legally competent adult can be a Trustee.</p>

              <p>The beneficiary is the person(s) or entity(ies) for whom the benefit of the trust is intended. Some beneficiaries may be current beneficiaries, meaning they receive a current benefit, such as income, from the trust. Others may be future beneficiaries, meaning they will not receive any benefit until some future point in time. Quite often, the future beneficiaries are to receive the assets of the trust upon the death of the current beneficiaries.</p>
              <p>Whenever a trust has one or more current beneficiaries who are different from the future beneficiaries, this is known as a split-interest trust because the trustee must serve two different sets of beneficiaries who may have conflicting interests.   The current beneficiary will typically desire income while the future beneficiary will typically desire growth of the trust assets; the trustee must serve the interests of both.</p>
