  <p>Similar to an individual, ownership of insurance by a trust is achieved either by having the trust purchase the policy or absolutely assigning the policy to the trust. If a pre-existing policy is assigned to the trust, then the same three-year rule applies.</p>
  <p>The trust MUST be irrevocable. An irrevocable trust cannot be altered once it is established. This is necessary so that the owner will never have any control over decisions that are made regarding the policy. If this were not the case, the policy might be includable in the insured's estate because he or she retained an incident of ownership. For similar reasons, the insured must not be the trustee. It is also advisable for the insured's spouse to not be trustee. </p>
<p>This type of trust arrangement, where an irrevocable trust is named as both the owner and beneficiary of an insurance policy, is known as an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT). Alternatively, such trusts are often referred to as Wealth Replacement Trusts or Asset Replacement Trusts because they are used to replace some of the wealth or assets that are eroded by estate taxes. They can be an excellent means of providing liquidity for an estate, which may be needed to pay estate taxes, while keeping the insurance itself out of the estate. </p>
<div class="explanation-widget-box"><p>One potential problem exists with an ILIT. If money must be contributed to the trust each year to fund premium payments, such contributions to an irrevocable trust do not typically qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion, and a gift tax return would have to be filed. However, there is common resolution to this issue. Without getting overly technical, the answer is to give a number of beneficiaries a temporary power to remove the contributed funds each year. Of course they need to not remove the funds if they are to be there to pay the premiums, but because these individuals have the power to take receipt of the money, even though their right is temporary, the gift to the trust will qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion. A landmark case by a family with the last name of Crummey established that this power is sufficient to qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion, hence these temporary powers of removal are referred to as Crummey powers and the trust itself is referred to as a Crummey Trust.</p></div>
