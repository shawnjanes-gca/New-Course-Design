              <p>Trusts are extremely flexible documents, and can be drawn to accomplish virtually any goal. The desire might be to provide income for the surviving spouse, with the remainder to the children upon the surviving spouse's death. It might be to provide liquidity with which to pay estate taxes. Or it might be to prevent the beneficiaries from receiving the insurance proceeds prior to a specific age. Thus the grantor, who forever surrenders the ability to make future changes to the trust, yet maintains control regarding the ultimate purpose and use of the funds, forever binds the trustee to comply with the terms of the trust.</p>

              <p>The trust is a unique tax entity, distinct from both the insured and the trustee. If the trustee dies, the policy is not part of the trustee&rsquo;s estate and therefore has no adverse impact upon the trustee&rsquo;s estate.</p>

              <p>Because the trust document is a legal document, binding the trustee to follow the directions of the trust, the insured has many choices regarding selection of a trustee. The insured may select any responsible individual or group of individuals to act as trustee, or may select an institutional trustee. In short, the insured is placing his or her trust in the law, not in an individual. Furthermore, the insured does not have to worry about being predeceased by the trustee. Since trusts never die, a successor trustee would simply be appointed to continue administering the trust.</p>
