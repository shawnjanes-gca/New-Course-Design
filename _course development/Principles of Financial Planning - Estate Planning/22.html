<p>In 2000, each individual received a credit against the gift and estate tax that protected the first $675,000 from the transfer tax.&nbsp; At the time, that was the largest credit in history, and it had taken 15 years for it to go from protecting&nbsp; $400,000 to protecting $675,000.</p>
But since 2000, the Applicable Credit/Exclusion amount has risen rapidly to protect the first $5,450,000 from taxation. This has virtually eliminated the federal transfer tax from being a planning issue for the vast majority of Americans.</div>

<p>In 2016, a married couple&rsquo;s combined Applical Exclusion Amounts can protect $10,900,000 of assets from transfer taxation. Even if everything is left to the surviving spouse, the executor merely files an estate tax return &ldquo;porting&rdquo; over the Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion Amount; no further planning is required. This combined amount is more than sufficient to protect the vast majority of married couples from having to worry about paying a federal estate tax.</p>
<p>Prior to 2011, it was not possible for a deceased spouse to pass on his or her Unused Exclusion Amount to a surviving spouse. This meant that any Unused Exclusion Amount in the first estate would be forever lost as an opportunity for protecting assets from&nbsp; the transfer tax. This resulted in the need for significant planning to optimize the use of both spouses&rsquo; Applicable Exclusion Amounts whenever their combined estates exceeded a single Applicable Exclusion Amount, as illustrated in the following example:</p>
<div class="example-box">
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>In 2009,&nbsp; Joe and Martha Average, a married couple who were both U.S. citizens, had a combined estate of $3.7 million. They had very simple wills whereby they left everything to the survivior.*</p>
<p>The Applicable Exclusion Amount in 2009 was $3.5 million. Together, they had a combined Applicable Exclusion Amount of $7 million &ndash; more than enough to protect their combined estate. However, this is what would have happened if both spouses died in 2009 when portability was not available:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="447" src="greene/pfp_estate_planning/images/Planning_Minimize_Estate_Taxes_Simpler.svg" width="396" /></p>
<p>Because the assets passed by way of the unlimited marital deduction, the first spouse&rsquo;s Applicable Exclusion amount goes unused and the surviving spouse&rsquo;s estate is left with all the assets and only a single Applicable Exclusion Amount to protect them from taxation. The result is that $200,000 of assets go unprotected, resulting in a tax bill of $90,000.</p>
<p>Clearly, in the days before portability, which allows the surviving spouse to inherit the Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE) amount, this simple plan could be quite costly.</p>
