  <p>An <strong><em>asset</em></strong> is any property owned by an individual or company that may have been purchased with cash or borrowed funds, received as a gift or inheritance, or acquired by a combination of these means.  It may also be an employee benefit paid for partially or totally by an employer.  Assets are listed on the balance sheet at<strong> <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair Market Value (FMV)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fair market value is the value a well-informed buyer is willing to accept from a well-informed seller when neither is compelled to buy or sell. As a practical matter when creating Financial Statements for purposes of financial planning, it is easier to determine market values of some assets versus others; for example, a publicly-traded common stock is easy to look up versus a residence, which may require an appraisal. Appraisals are generally unnecessary for planning purposes. (For insurance purposes, it may be appropriate to recommend appraisals of certain collectibles, antiques, valuable jewelry, etc.) In any case, it may be helpful to include in the footnotes how market values of assets on the Balance Sheet were determined.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">fair market value (FMV)</a></strong> and are generally divided into at least three classifications: cash and cash equivalents, investments, and personal use assets.<span class="pageInstruction">  Click each to learn more.</span></p>

              <p><strong><em>Cash and cash equivalents</em></strong> are the most liquid of the assets, meaning they can easily and quickly be converted into cash, with little or no risk of loss of principal. This can be a controversial subject of debate - but in general, the following are considered cash and cash equivalent assets:</p>

              <p><strong><em>Investments</em></strong> are generally assets that are held for income, growth, or capital appreciation.  This can include a wide variety of asset types and the planner will often wish to divide the assets into subcategories. There is no &quot;correct&quot; method. In fact, &quot;investments&rdquo; may not even be an asset classification itself. For example, it could be replaced by Marketable Securities, Retirement Assets, Education Funds, Business Assets, Real Property, Collectibles, etc.  Assets in the general category of &quot;investments&quot; could include at least the following:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Marketable Securities:      stocks, bonds, options, debentures, warrants, etc.</li>

                  <li>Limited partnership      interests</li>

                  <li>Retirement accounts</li>

              <p><strong><em>Personal use assets</em></strong> are used for the personal enjoyment or benefit of the client rather than held for investment purposes.  They are generally the least liquid of the assets.  In some cases, however, these assets may be significant factors in retirement planning because of substantial value and/or appreciation or even income potential. Examples of Personal Use Assets are:</p>
