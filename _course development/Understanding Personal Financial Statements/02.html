<p>The <strong><em>statement of financial position</em></strong> (a.k.a. <strong><em>balance sheet</em></strong>) is a snapshot of a person's financial position at a specific point in time. The following are a few common characteristics of a balance sheet.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All assets and liabilities in the statement are valued as of a specific date. This date should always be included in the heading of the statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assets and liabilities in a personal financial statement are listed at the fair market value as of the date of the statement unless otherwise noted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assets will be listed, usually broken up into subcategories, and a sum of all assets calculated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liabilities will be listed, usually broken up into subcategories, and a sum of all liabilities calculated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will total assets and liabilities and calculate net worth:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Liabilities + Net Worth = Assets</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assets and liabilities traditionally are listed side-by-side in two columns. However, financial professionals often prefer a single column format so that additional information or pro-forma projections (e.g., projected values resulting from recommendations and/or projected values in future years) can be added to the right in additional columns.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The assets and liabilities are typically broken down into subcategories and subtotaled. The subcategories will vary by practitioner preferences and the characteristics of the client's situation.</p>
<p>As noted above, financial professionals will present their Financial Statements according to their own preferences or client characteristics. We have structured two different Balance Sheets for Jack and Jill Client with the same data. Go to the next page to review the first example.</p>
