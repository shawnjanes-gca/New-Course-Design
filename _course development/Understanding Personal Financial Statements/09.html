  <p>Remember, cash receipts are not necessarily taxable or the same thing as income. Â A cash receipt included in the Statement of Cash Flows must fall within the designated period (usually a calendar year). We have allocated cash receipts into three categories in the table below that would usually include the items shown.</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" style="text-align:center;"><strong>Earned Income</strong></th>
        <th scope="col" style="text-align:center;"><strong>Investment Income</strong></th>
        <th scope="col" style="text-align:center;"><strong>Other Receipts</strong></th>

  <h3>Cash Disbursements</h3>
  <p>Cash disbursements are not necessarily just &quot;expenses.&quot; Remember that the cash disbursement included in the Statement of Cash Flows must fall within the designated period (usually a calendar year). Disbursements may include capital investments, purchase of investment assets, debt principal repayments, cash gifts, etc. We have also allocated cash disbursements into three categories in the table below that would usually include the items shown.</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
    <thead>
      <tr >
        <th scope="col" style="text-align:center;"><strong>Personal/Family Living Expenses</strong></th>
        <th scope="col" style="text-align:center;"><strong>Financial/Investments</strong></th>
        <th scope="col" style="text-align:center;"><strong>Other Distributions</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align:top"><ul type="disc">
          <li>Income taxes (paid, not accrued</li>
          <li>Payroll taxes</li>
          <li>Consumer debt/mortgage loan payments</li>
          <li>Capital improvements to residence</li>
          <li>Purchase of substantial personal use assets for cash (a car or boat)</li>
      </ul>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align:top"><ul type="disc">
          <li>Investment purchases</li>
          <li>Reinvestment of interest, dividends, or capital gain distributions</li>
          <li>Retirement plan contributions</li>
          <li>Investment asset expenses/capital expenditures</li>
      </ul>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align:top"><ul type="disc">
          <li>Repayment of debt principal</li>
          <li>Cash gifts</li>

    <h3>Important Note</h3>
    <p>Note also a few items that are taxable income but not cash receipts:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Phantom      income is taxable income but occurs when no cash is distributed (for      example, from a partnership or Subchapter S corporation that reports      taxable income to partners or shareholders, but does not distribute the      same amount or possibly any cash - we will discuss these entities later in      this course and in the Income Tax course)</li>
      <li>Taxable employee benefits not distributed as cash (such as group life insurance that exceeds $50,000 paid for by an employer)  </li>
    </ul>
