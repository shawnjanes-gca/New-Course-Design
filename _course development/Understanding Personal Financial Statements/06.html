  <p>Liabilities are any debt, claim, or potential loss.  They are typically classified as either current or long-term.  With extensive liabilities, they may be further broken down by repayment completion dates, types of debt, etc. It is generally far too tedious to list current outstanding bills unless they are substantial. It would be appropriate to list significant and long overdue bills such as past-due income taxes. Each individual situation will dictate what liabilities are included on the financial statement or at least mentioned in the footnotes. Contingent liabilities, such as co-signing a car loan for a child, should be included in the footnotes.</p>
  <p>Net worth, as its name and position on the statement imply, is an indicator of a person&rsquo;s total wealth, but does nothing to reveal the nature of the assets and liabilities.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Net worth</em></strong>, also called <strong><em>shareholder&rsquo;s equity</em></strong> or <strong><em>net assets</em></strong> in a business, is simply the total assets minus total liabilities. It is defined as the amount of equity the client has in owned assets.</p>
                <p>Net worth will generally increase as a result of the following:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Additional cash account balances, savings account      balances, or investments from discretionary income, gifts or inheritances.</li>
                  <li>Appreciation in the value of assets</li>
                  <li>Reduction of liabilities (note that if loan principal      is paid from cash, net worth will remain unchanged UNLESS the principal is      reduced with Discretionary Cash Flow). Also, forgiveness of a loan would      increase net worth.</li>
                  <li>Employer contributions to employee benefit and/or retirement plans.              </li>
