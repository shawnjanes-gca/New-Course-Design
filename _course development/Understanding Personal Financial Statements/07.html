  <p>Why is the <strong><em>statement of financial position</em></strong> (a.k.a. <strong><em>balance sheet</em></strong>) one of the two fundamental documents that a financial professional uses?Â  A review of the client's Balance Sheet can tell us a great deal about the client and their financial position that is both obvious and maybe not so obvious.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>We have listed some of these insights below. Can you think of any others?</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>What      is the size of their assets, liabilities and estate?</li>
      <li>What      is the amount of their net worth?</li>
      <li>What      is the size of their estate(s) in the event of death?</li>
      <li>How      close are they to financial independence, or ability to retire?</li>
      <li>How      diversified are the client&rsquo;s assets?</li>
      <li>What      is the nature of assets?</li>
      <li>What      is their investment personality (saver, speculator, etc.?) If married, do      the spouses demonstrate different risk tolerances? Are they the same risk      tolerances that they said they had when interviewed?</li>
      <li>Are      they realistic about their financial goals?</li>
      <li>What      level of sophistication do they demonstrate?</li>
      <li>How      dependent are they on employer benefits for retirement resources?</li>
      <li>Client&rsquo;s      liquidity position. Do they need to build a more substantial emergency fund?</li>
      <li>How have they used debt? Prudently or      not?</li>
      <li>What possible areas or issues need      immediate attention? (Possibly too much short-term debt or too many assets      in taxable cash reserves, etc.)</li>
      <li>Are      the initial stated client objectives attainable?</li>
      <li>Periodic      updating keeps the client(s) and advisor aware of changes or reminds them      of issues that require continued attention.</li>
      <li>At least annual updating illustrates the progress (or lack of progress) being made by the client.  </li>
    </ul>

  <p>Other more detailed analyses will typically be done by a financial professional using pieces of the data from this Balance Sheet, such as a risk management analysis, a retirement income projection, need for college savings, a budget analysis, an estate planning review, etc. In these cases, more details regarding the assets and liabilities may be obtained by the financial professional, but they are not necessarily shown on the Balance Sheet.</p>
  <p>Clients typically have two major financial resources; their assets and their ability to earn an income. They also have liability payment obligations and expenses. Hopefully, they are investing discretionary cash flow and reducing liabilities in order to attain greater security and financial independence. The addition of a Statement of Cash Flows gives us a much more comprehensive snapshot of a client's current financial position, which we review on the next page.</p>
