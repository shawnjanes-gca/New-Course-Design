  <p>A <strong><em>Statement of Cash Flows</em></strong> is sometimes referred to as a &quot;<strong><em>statement of income and expenses.&quot;  </em></strong>Most, but not all, practitioners believe that there is a clarifying distinction between the two. Most advisors use a Statement of Cash Flows to list <strong><em>all</em></strong> cash receipts and disbursements of the client during a specified period of time regardless of their nature. Cash Receipts may include more than &quot;income,&quot; such as gifts received, inheritances, liquidation of investment capital that does not include or even have a gain, etc. Cash Disbursements include living, household, personal, fixed, or variable &quot;expenses,&quot; but also include investment purchases, cash gifts to family members or trusts, etc. These &quot;non-expense&quot; cash disbursements usually have a corresponding effect on the Balance Sheet by increasing assets or reducing liabilities. Cash gifts could be deemed &quot;expenses&quot; because they reduce cash without a corresponding increase in an asset or decrease in a liability, but they would not be considered part of the routine living expenses of the client.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that these rules are not subject to strict guidelines, let alone agreement among practitioners. It is important to be consistent so that the statements are clear and meaningful to the financial advisor as well as to the client. It is important for the financial professional to gain an accurate understanding of <strong><em>all</em></strong> resources of cash receipts and allocations of cash disbursements. Review the Statement of Cash Flows below.<strong>  </strong>Notice how the footnotes add additional insight to the assets and liabilities. (Some of the footnotes in these examples are obviously directed to the student vs. an actual part of the financial statements.)</p>
