<blockquote>
<p>When looking at two balance sheets dated one year apart, it is easy to identify <strong><em>where</em></strong> changes have occurred, but it is not so easy to identify <strong><em>why</em></strong> changes have occurred. These changes between balance sheets are caused by the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Discretionary Cash Flow (surplus or deficit) for the same time period.</strong> In the case of a deficit, liabilities have probably been increased and/or assets have been decreased. In the case of a surplus, liabilities have probably been decreased and/or assets have been increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changes in the market value of assets.</strong> This dynamic obviously occurs regardless of whether or not net discretionary cash flow is positive (surplus) or negative (deficit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An asset other than cash being exchanged for assets; e.g., when buying a new car, the credit given for the old car.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assets other than cash received as a gift or inheritance.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liabilities are forgiven or paid by another party (a gift).</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An investment account may show up as worth $50,000 in the latest balance sheet, but the prior balance sheet might show it as worth $40,000. The $10,000 increase in its value may have been caused by a contribution of additional cash into the account or an increase in the market value of the securities in the account, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>A new vacation home may appear on the current end-of-year balance sheet that was not on the previous year's balance sheet. This asset could have been totally or partially gifted or inherited, purchased for cash, purchased with borrowed funds or any combination of the above.</p>
<p>A grandparent pays off a grandchild's student loan. This will reduce the student's liabilities but would not show up on a Statement of Cash Flows.</p>

<p>A review of changes in net worth is an issue that will be of value to the client. This can often be handled in footnotes to statements. In other cases, it may be addressed in specialized reports, such as a review of investment or retirement portfolio performance.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a client's net worth will actually change on a daily basis. Income is received (net worth increases), bills are paid (net worth decreases), assets, particularly marketable securities, may fluctuate in value every day (net worth may go up or down), etc. A Statement of Cash Flows typically only provides useful information over longer periods of time, such as year to year. For a wealthier client with an uneven income, projections that break down periods into smaller time periods (such as monthly or quarterly) may provide assistance to the client when making decisions regarding sizable cash expenditures.</p>
