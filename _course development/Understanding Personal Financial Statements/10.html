<h2>The Uses and Benefits of the Statement of Cash Flows</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The Statement of Cash Flows is extremely useful to financial professionals because instead of taking a snapshot of the client's financial picture, like the balance sheet, it presents the client's financial activities over a time interval. This can give the financial professionals a better understanding of exactly how the client earns, spends, and maintains wealth.</p>
<p>The Statement of Cash Flows can be prepared with two simultaneous perspectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, it can be prepared after all receipts and disbursements have been realized, making it useful for comparison to budgeted goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or it can be prepared in advance, making it useful for budgeting and/or planning for the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Information Revealed by the Statement of Cash Flows</strong></h3>
<p><br /> Specifically, among other things, the Statement of Cash Flows can reveal some or all of the following:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The size of the client's net discretionary cash flow; surplus or deficit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary reasons for surplus or deficit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can tell the advisor a great deal about the client's financial personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically reveals numerous opportunities for improvements in the management of income tax and cash flow planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In most cases, it will be the first time a client has seen a snapshot of where their money is coming from and particularly where it is going. For many clients, this statement will be a very significant "revelation" and a motivator to alter spending and saving habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serves as a foundation for more specialized statements such as Income Tax Projections (for Income Tax Planning) or a more detailed analysis of household expenditures for development of a household budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the Statement of Cash Flows has been established for a client, future updates are relatively easy to implement plus the initial format can be expanded for alternative pro-forma or "what if" projections based on a wide range of hypothetical scenarios or recommendations.</p>
