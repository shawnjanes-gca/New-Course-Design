  </h1>
  <p>The Statement of Cash Flows is extremely useful to financial professionals because instead of taking a snapshot of the client&rsquo;s financial picture, like the balance sheet, it presents the client&rsquo;s financial activities over a time interval.Â  This can give the financial professionals a better understanding of exactly how the client earns, spends, and maintains wealth.</p>
  <p>The Statement of Cash Flows can be prepared with two simultaneous perspectives:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1" style="width:95%">
    <li><span>First, it can be prepared after all receipts and disbursements have been realized, making it useful for comparison to budgeted goals.</span></li>
    <li><span>Or it can be prepared in advance, making it useful for budgeting and/or planning for the future.</span></li>
  </ol>

    <div align="center"><p><strong>Information Revealed by the Statement of Cash Flows</strong></p></div>
    <p>Specifically, among other things, the Statement of Cash Flows can reveal some or all of the following:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>The      size of the client&rsquo;s net discretionary cash flow; surplus or deficit.</li>
      <li>The      primary reasons for surplus or deficit.</li>
      <li>Can      tell the advisor a great deal about the client's financial personality.</li>
      <li>Typically      reveals numerous opportunities for improvements in the management of      income tax and cash flow planning.</li>
      <li>In      most cases, it will be the first time a client has seen a snapshot of      where their money is coming from and particularly where it is going. For      many clients, this statement will be a very significant      &quot;revelation&quot; and a motivator to alter spending and saving      habits. </li>
      <li>Serves      as a foundation for more specialized statements such as Income Tax      Projections (for Income Tax Planning) or a more detailed analysis of      household expenditures for development of a household budget.</li>
      <li>Once the Statement of Cash Flows has been established for a client, future updates are relatively easy to implement plus the initial format can be expanded for alternative pro-forma or &quot;what if&quot; projections based on a wide range of hypothetical scenarios or recommendations.  </li>
    </ul>
