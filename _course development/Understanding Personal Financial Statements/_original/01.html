<p>In this course, we will focus our attention on the two primary personal financial statements and also how to apply those statements to ratios financial professionals can use to evaluate liquidity and provide feedback for their clients.</p>
<p>The two key personal financial statements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Statement of Cash Flows </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The financial statements can be interpreted through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Liquidity Ratios</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In the financial planning process, financial professionals accumulate a great deal of data and information about their client. In order to analyze the client's current financial position relative to their goals, the professional needs to assimilate this information and data into interpretive, workable pieces. Two of the fundamental tools used by professionals to create a clear snapshot of the client's current financial resources and obligations are the following two financial statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Statement of Current Financial Position (or Balance Sheet)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Statement of Cash Flows (or Income and Expense Statement)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are not "official" names for these statements. The names will vary by practitioner as well as the layout of the statements. However, each of these two statements has a common purpose by all financial professionals and provides a great deal of information. For a variety of reasons, a financial professional may prepare several other financial statements for a client, such as a retirement income analysis, a retirement accumulation plan, an educational funding plan, a personal budget evaluation, an asset allocation analysis, a hypothetical probate for estate planning, etc. However, the Balance Sheet and the Statement of Cash Flows provide critical fundamental information about the client's financial position that serves as the foundation upon which analyses can be created.</p>
