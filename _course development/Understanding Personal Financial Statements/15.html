  <p>Another ratio can be quickly calculated to provide a snapshot of a client's liquidity risk by calculating the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Both of these classifications are defined somewhat differently by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and various financial advisors. In this case, financial professionals are not subject to FASB guidelines and financial professionals can even create their own ratios if they like. We define these terms as follows:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong><u>Current Assets:</u></strong>  Cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory and accounts receivable (inventory or receivables may be owned by a sole proprietor)</p>
    <p><strong><u>Current Liabilities:</u></strong>  Credit card debt, taxes payable, accounts payable (accounts payable may be owed by a sole proprietor), and any debts that are due within one year.</p>
  </div>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the case of Jack and Jill Client, we will need to pick assets out of their Balance Sheet to determine the two totals. In the abbreviated portions of the Balance Sheet below, we have highlighted the Current Assets in yellow and the Current Liabilities in blue. The auto loan is included in the definition because we know that the loan only has six payments left and is totally due and payable within one year. We will presume that Jack and Jill have no tax liabilities since they are not listed on the Balance Sheet and we also assume they are both subject to withholding.</p>
  <p>--Insert Chart--</p>
  <p>The Current Assets thus total $95,500 and the Current Liabilities total $1,800.</p>
  <p>--Insert Chart--</p>
  <p>Using the Current Ratio formula, we calculate the Clients' Current Ratio as follows:</p>
  <p>--Insert Chart--</p>
  <p>A Current Ratio of at least 1.00 is considered adequate.  A ratio of 2.00 is considered good. As you can see, the Clients' Current Ratio is excellent. Note, however, that a Current Ratio can change rapidly. If the financial professional has historical data, it would be informative to evaluate how stable the Current Ratio has been in the past, and it should be monitored in the future.</p>
