    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A fundamental tenet of sound financial planning is for every client to establish and maintain an &quot;emergency fund&quot; of highly liquid assets that can serve as a reliable resource in the event of a lost job, disability, or any unexpected event that strains cash resources. Substantial cash resources can also allow the client to take advantage of unexpected investment opportunities, assist others in need, and/or allow the client to take advantage of discounted cash purchases and utilize higher deductibles when insuring a variety of risks. A cash reserve, supplemented by established lines of credit may also prove to be an appropriate strategy, but if the client has a serious financial reversal, additional debt is not likely to be a good option. The vast majority of our clients are trying to move toward financial independence where earned income is an optional activity. This usually involves minimizing debt, or at least using debt as a strategic, versus necessary financial tool.</p>
  <p>In order to determine the adequacy of a client's Emergency Fund, we need to determine three things:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><span>What is an adequate      Emergency Fund amount?</span></li>
    <li><span>What assets are included      in an Emergency Fund and what is their current value?</span></li>
    <li><span>What categories of monthly      expenses should be included for payment by the Emergency Fund and what is      the estimated monthly total?</span></li>
  </ol>
<p>We will address the answers to these three questions one by one and then calculate the adequacy of Jack and Jill Clients' Emergency Fund using data from their Financial Statements that we reviewed earlier in this course.</p>

            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>There is a consensus among financial professionals regarding an adequate size of an Emergency Fund (EF) that many financial professionals consider appropriate:</p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li><span>The EF should be able to <strong><em>cover three months</em></strong> of &quot;fixed and variable&quot; expenses if :</span></li>

              <li><span>The client is single and has an additional and reliable source of income other than earned compensation.</span></li>
              <li><span>The client(s) is/are married and both spouses have substantive and reliable earned income.</span></li>
              <li><span>The client(s) is/are married and one spouse has an additional and reliable source of income other than the earned compensation of one spouse.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <li><span>The EF should be able to cover six months of &quot;fixed and variable&quot; expenses if:</span></li>
              <ol start="a" type="a">
              <li><span>The client is single and does not have an additional and reliable source of income other than earned compensation.</span></li>

            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Alimony, child support, a trust fund providing substantive income and/or rights of withdrawal, or an investment portfolio that can provide substantive income are examples of good secondary sources of income. For the vast majority of clients, these secondary sources will be either nonexistent or only partially adequate to replace lost earned income.</p>

            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>In a word (or two) - cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are assets that can be liquidated quickly and easily without loss of value. (We define Marketability as the availability of a market to purchase a seller's assets at any price).<strong></strong></p>

            <p>Determining the amount of expenses to be included in the EF calculation is somewhat subjective and one where feedback from the client is important. However, we are not addressing an issue of precision here - we are merely trying to get a snapshot view of how well the client can weather a financial storm. Let's assume that we have reviewed the above disbursements regarding their ongoing necessity in the event Jack or Jill loses their job, and we have concluded the following disbursements are not &quot;flexible&quot; in 2016:</p>
