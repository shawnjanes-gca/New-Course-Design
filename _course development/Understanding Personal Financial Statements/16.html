  <p>The Debt-to-Income Ratio is useful in determining a person&rsquo;s ability to carry debt payments out of current income.  This ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="451" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>Debt-To-Income Ratio = Monthly Debt Payments ÷</strong> <strong>Monthly Gross Income</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>To make the calculation, you simply total your monthly debt payments and divide them by the monthly gross income. For example, if total debt payments are $2,000 per month and monthly gross income (before taxes and other deductions) is $10,000 per month, then the debt-to-income ratio is $2,000 ÷ $10,000 = .20, or 20%. People with high debt-to-income ratios are generally at greater risk of default; for this reason, they are less likely to qualify for loans or mortgages.</p>
  <p>For example, when applying for a home mortgage, the lender will look at two ratios. One ratio will look at your monthly housing payment (principal and interest, escrow deposits for taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance premium, homeowners&rsquo; dues, etc.) as a percentage of monthly gross income. The other ratio is the debt-to-income ratio, including the monthly housing payment as part of the monthly debt.</p>
