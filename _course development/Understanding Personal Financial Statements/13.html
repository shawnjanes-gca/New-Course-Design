  <p>Technical calculations can be helpful as snapshots of the client's financial health relative to consensus norms, such as measuring liquidity, amount of debt relative to assets, or cash receipts. In this course, we will discuss the two most commonly used ratios that financial professionals use to evaluate client liquidity. In addition, we will examine the most commonly used ratio to determine a person&rsquo;s ability to support debt from current income.</p>
  <p>The two most common liquidity ratios are the emergency funds ratio and the current ratio. These ratios measure the ability of the client to meet short-term cash demands by comparing required monthly living expenses and short-term liabilities to liquid term assets.Â  Examples of each can be seen on the next two pages.</p>
