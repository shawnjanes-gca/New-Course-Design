  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Estate Tax Consequences</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The fact that some forms of joint property escape probate does not necessarily mean that the property escapes estate taxes.  Ignoring community property for the moment, just what are the consequences of joint ownership for estate tax purposes? </p>

              <p>The estate tax consequences of Joint Tenancy depend upon whether or not the joint tenants are married. If they are not married (non-spousal), then when one owner dies the <strong>IRS will presume that the decedent owned 100% of the property</strong>. The only way to keep the full amount from being included on the tax return is to prove that the surviving joint tenant(s) contributed funds for its acquisition. If such evidence can be furnished, then the decedent's interest in the property would be reduced to the percentage of the purchase that was actually supplied by the decedent.</p>
              <p><strong>The burden of proof will be upon the executor.</strong> As is shown in the following example, keeping adequate records of the original purchase and all subsequent improvements is vitally important.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>Example.</strong> <em>Two brothers, Dan and David, purchase a $100,000 piece of property in 1980 in Joint Tenancy, with Dan contributing $60,000 and David contributing $40,000.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;">Assuming adequate records, it is simple to calculate their interests at 60% and 40%. If David were to die today, when the property is worth $500,000, then 40% of its value ($200,000) would be included in his estate. But what happens if in the interim years Dan had made improvements to the property?</p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;"><em>Suppose that prior to David's death, Dan made $50,000 of improvements to the property in 1988. Prior to making those improvements, the property had also appreciated in value to $200,000. Assuming all records were kept, how much would be included in David's estate if he were to die today when the total property is worth $500,000?</em></p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;">As can be seen in the chart below, just prior to making the improvements in 1988, Dan owned 60% ($120,000) and David owned 40% ($80,000). Once the $50,000 improvement was made, Dan's interest became $120,000 + $50,000; David's interest remains $80,000. Dan's share then increases from 60% to 68% of the property (170,000/250,000 = 68%), while reducing David's interest to 32%. Note:  David's interest was still worth $80,000 (32% of $250,000 = $80,000). With these changes, if David were to die today with the total property worth $500,000, then 32% of $500,000 ($160,000) would be included in his estate.</p>

              <p><strong>For couples married after 1976 and acquiring joint property after that date, ½ of the property is included in the decedent's taxable estate</strong>, regardless of the source of funds with which the purchase was made.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>Be aware</strong> that some courts have ruled that if the couple married prior to 1977 and acquired joint property prior to 1977, then the property is treated just as non-spousal Joint Tenancy. Therefore, a specialist should be consulted when planning involves this situation.</p>
