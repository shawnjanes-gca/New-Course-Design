  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Pitfalls of Joint Tenancy</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>For many people, Joint Tenancy is an effective estate planning tool because:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>It is simple </li>
    <li>It provides survivor      benefit </li>
    <li>It avoids probate </li>
  </ul>
<p>But there are factors that must be considered and situations where it is clearly ill advised to use it for estate planning.</p>
  <h3>Potential Disadvantages for Spouses</h3>
  <p>When planning for spouses, you must look at factors such as life expectancy, cost basis, and relative size of estates when making decisions about utilizing Joint Tenancy. The two most common situations where Joint Tenancy might be a bad idea are:</p>

              <p>If the combined assets result in a taxable estate, then good estate planning should allow each spouse to make use of their applicable credit amount and shelter some assets from inclusion in the estate of the surviving spouse. Optimal planning might be curtailed if too much property is in Joint Tenancy.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, it is desirable for a surviving spouse to have a 100% step-up in basis on inherited property. With Joint Tenancy, only half of the property will receive a step-up in basis.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>Example</strong>: Robert and Sylvia Thompson bought their home thirty years ago for $200,000. It is titled JTWROS, and today it is worth $1,000,000. Robert is 20 years older than Sylvia and in poor health. Anticipating that he will predecease her, Sylvia plans to sell the home upon his death and move closer to her children. Assuming current market values, when Robert dies, his half of the property will receive a step-up in basis, thereby raising the basis of his half of the home to $500,000. By adding that $500,000 to Sylvia&rsquo;s basis of $100,000, the new basis becomes $600,000. When she sells the property for $1,000,000, she will have a gain of $400,000 ($1,000,000 - $600,000 basis). Since this is her primary residence, IRS rules state that she may exclude $250,000 of gain for tax purposes, leaving her $150,000 of taxable gain.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>What would happen if Robert owned the property outright?</strong> Because transfers between spouses are not taxable events, Sylvia could transfer her interest with no tax consequence. If it is desirable to keep their estates equalized, Robert might transfer assets to Sylvia that have little or no capital appreciation. When Robert dies, she receives the property from his estate with a full step-up in basis. When she sells the property, there would be no taxable gain.</p>
