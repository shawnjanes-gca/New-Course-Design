  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Pitfalls of Joint Tenancy</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>For many people, Joint Tenancy is an effective estate planning tool because:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>It is simple </li>
    <li>It provides survivor      benefit </li>
    <li>It avoids probate </li>
  </ul>
<p>But there are factors that must be considered and situations where it is clearly ill advised to use it for estate planning.</p>
  <h3>Potential Disadvantages for Spouses</h3>
  <p>When planning for spouses, you must look at factors such as life expectancy, cost basis, and relative size of estates when making decisions about utilizing Joint Tenancy. The two most common situations where Joint Tenancy might be a bad idea are:</p>

            <div class="p7ap3-col-wrapper no-columns">
              <p>If the combined assets result in a taxable estate, then good estate planning should allow each spouse to make use of their applicable credit amount and shelter some assets from inclusion in the estate of the surviving spouse. Optimal planning might be curtailed if too much property is in Joint Tenancy.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, it is desirable for a surviving spouse to have a 100% step-up in basis on inherited property. With Joint Tenancy, only half of the property will receive a step-up in basis.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>Example</strong>: Robert and Sylvia Thompson bought their home thirty years ago for $200,000. It is titled JTWROS, and today it is worth $1,000,000. Robert is 20 years older than Sylvia and in poor health. Anticipating that he will predecease her, Sylvia plans to sell the home upon his death and move closer to her children. Assuming current market values, when Robert dies, his half of the property will receive a step-up in basis, thereby raising the basis of his half of the home to $500,000. By adding that $500,000 to Sylvia&rsquo;s basis of $100,000, the new basis becomes $600,000. When she sells the property for $1,000,000, she will have a gain of $400,000 ($1,000,000 - $600,000 basis). Since this is her primary residence, IRS rules state that she may exclude $250,000 of gain for tax purposes, leaving her $150,000 of taxable gain.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>What would happen if Robert owned the property outright?</strong> Because transfers between spouses are not taxable events, Sylvia could transfer her interest with no tax consequence. If it is desirable to keep their estates equalized, Robert might transfer assets to Sylvia that have little or no capital appreciation. When Robert dies, she receives the property from his estate with a full step-up in basis. When she sells the property, there would be no taxable gain.</p>

<h3>Potential Disadvantages for Non-Spouses</h3>
<p>For non-spouses, the major pitfalls of Joint Tenancy deal with loss of control and the potential for undermining a previously constructed estate plan. These pitfalls are illustrated by the following examples, and could all be avoided with other estate planning vehicles</p>

            <p><strong><em>Example. </em></strong>Mrs. Howard has been widowed for some years. She owns her own home outright and, wishing to avoid probate, she transfers her home in Joint Tenancy with her daughter. Mrs. Howard now wishes to marry, sell the home, and move to another state. Her daughter disapproves of this marriage, and has refused to go along with the sale.</p>

            <p>As Mrs. Booker became elderly and in need of assistance, she titled most of her property as JTWROS with her youngest daughter, Julie, who lived closer than her other three children. While she thought of it as a convenience, believing her will would distribute everything equally among the children; she had effectively disinherited the other children. Once a close family, a rift developed following Mrs. Booker's death, and for years the other children have not spoken with Julie.</p>

<h3>Read the Agreement Carefully</h3>
<p>Because of this risk of Joint Tenancy, many states have laws that spell out the consequences of establishing certain types of joint accounts, such as checking/savings accounts and CDs. But most states leave it to the terms of the account agreement. Generally, such accounts fall into three categories. As can be seen by their description below, it is imperative that they be read carefully to understand the consequences.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Joint Tenancy with immediate vesting. </strong>A gift of ½ of the assets occurs when the second person is added to the account, and each is taxed on ½ the income. </li>
  <li><strong>Revocable account.</strong> Income is reported on the basis of each person's contribution. No gift occurs when the account is opened, but does occur if one person withdraws more than he/she contributed. </li>
  <li><strong>Convenience account.</strong> One person contributes all the funds, and the other person is simply able to act as their agent in depositing or withdrawing funds. There is no gift when creating the account or when withdrawing funds as agent. Depending upon the terms of the agreement, the agent may or may not inherit the funds upon the death of the other person.</li>
</ul>
