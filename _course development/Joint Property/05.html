<h2>What is the Default Position?</h2>
<p>While many people give some thought to titling of real estate, most do not typically think to designate the type of co-ownership they are creating when opening financial accounts. Generally speaking, such ownership is Tenants in Common unless there is a deliberate indication that it is joint with right of survivorship. This is usually indicated by adding the letters JTWROS (Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship) to the account.</p>
<p>The same is true with wills and trusts, which often distribute assets to multiple owners. Unless the document specifically indicates that the property is to be distributed as Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship, it is assumed to be Tenants in Common. The importance of this assumption is illustrated below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example.</em></strong> Mr. Jacobs indicated in his will that his farm was to be distributed to his three children: Jason, Claudia, and Matthew. Matthew died prior to Mr. Jacobs. Upon Mr. Jacobs' death, the executor distributed a 1/3 interest in the farm to Matthew's family. Had he not made that assumption that the property was to be distributed as Tenants in Common, Matthew's family (which included two of Mr. Jacobs' grandchildren) would have been disinherited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, Tenants in Common is the default form of ownership. It requires an extra step to create Joint Tenancy.</p>
