<h2>Estate Implications of Community Property</h2>
<p>What happens with community property when one spouse dies? The most important points to remember are the following:</p>
<div id="Layer1" style="position: absolute; width: 543px; height: 29px; z-index: 1; left: 182px; top: 182px; visibility: hidden;">
<table style="width: 100%;" border="3" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td height="20">Jointly held property that automatically transfers to the survivor when one owner dies.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div id="Layer2" style="position: absolute; width: 475px; height: 29px; z-index: 1; left: 250px; top: 135px; visibility: hidden;">
<table style="width: 100%;" border="3" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td height="20">A form of joint ownership that is restricted to husband and wife. Full ownership automatically transfers to the survivor upon death of one spouse.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div id="Layer3" style="position: absolute; width: 312px; height: 29px; z-index: 1; left: 73px; top: 200px; visibility: hidden;">
<table style="width: 100%;" border="3" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td height="20">A trust for the benefit of a surviving spouse that is included in the surviving spouse's taxable estate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Community property is subject to probate.</strong> In this regard, it differs from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a onmouseover="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" onmouseout="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="#">joint tenancy</a></span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a onmouseover="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" onmouseout="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="#">tenancy by the entirety</a><strong></strong></span>. This means it is possible for the decedent's will to appoint the property to someone other than the surviving spouse. State laws vary as to what happens if there is no will; in some states it goes to the surviving spouse while in other states it goes to the decedent's lineal descendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Half of the community property is included in the estate of the first to die. </strong>But since community property qualifies for the unlimited marital deduction, it can be willed to the surviving spouse or placed in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a onmouseover="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" onmouseout="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="#">marital trust</a></span> and the tax will be deferred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All debts incurred during marriage regarding community property are community property debts</strong>, and half of them would be claims against the estate of a deceased spouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The surviving spouse gets a step-up in basis on the entire property </strong>if at least &frac12; of the whole property is included in the deceased spouse's gross estate.<sup>1</sup> This ability to receive a step-up on the entire property may be sufficient reason for spouses to convert separate property (e.g., acquired prior to marriage) into community property. In some states, it is possible for spouses to change separate property into community property, and vice versa, simply by written agreement between them. This ability to get a potential full step-up in basis on the property as a whole is the most valuable estate planning feature of community property, as the following example illustrates. <br /> <br /> <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><sup>1</sup>A potential exception to this statement exists if death occurred in 2010 when it was possible to elect out of estate tax treatment. If the Executor elected out of estate tax treatment, then the ability to receive this step up in basis could be subject to some limitations.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Example. </em></strong>Howard and Theresa Woods purchased some land in Tennessee as an investment prior to moving to Texas (a community property state). They purchased the property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and still desire to pass their interest on to the surviving spouse. Today, they are trying to decide if it would be wise to change this investment into community property, even though that would make it subject to probate. They purchased the property five years ago for $100,000 and it is worth $300,000 today. What planning might they want to consider?</p>
<p><strong><em>Answer.</em></strong> If they leave the land in joint tenancy, when one spouse dies there will be a step-up in basis on half of the property. If the surviving spouse were to sell the house, the surviving spouse would have a basis of $200,000 and a capital gain of $100,000 upon its sale. Assuming a capital gains tax of 15%, that results in a tax bill of $15,000. But if they converted it to community property, the entire property would receive a step-up in basis, and the survivor would own the property with a basis of $300,000 and no capital gain upon its sale.</p>

<h3>Special Circumstances:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Life Insurance.</strong> While the laws are complex and vary from state to state, it is generally true that if a person purchases life insurance in a community property state, retains an incident of ownership, remains domiciled in that state and pays all premiums in that state, then the insurance proceeds are community property for the surviving spouse, and only &frac12; of the policy benefits will be included in the deceased owner's estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Qualified Employee Benefit Plans.</strong> An employee's spouse may have a community interest in the employee's qualified benefit plan. If the employee's spouse dies first, then the spouse's interest would be included in the gross estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Divorce. </strong>Upon divorce, community property is divided equally and is owned by each party as tenants in common.</p>
</li>
</ul>
