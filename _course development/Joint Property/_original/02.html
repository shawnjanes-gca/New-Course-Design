</li>
<li>
<p><em>What is the extent of each person's ownership?</em> <strong>Each person holds a percentage interest in the property, the size of which can vary among the co-owners.</strong> Usually, their ownership interest is proportional to their contribution to the purchase of the property. Here too, their interest in the property is undivided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What happens when one owner dies? </em>This type of ownership does not bypass probate, unless it is held in trust. Nor does the owner's interest terminate at death. <strong>While alive, each owner has the right to transfer his/her percentage interest at any time, to whomever they wish, independently of the other owners. In like manner, at death, their interest will be distributed according to the terms of their will. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When is it appropriate?</em> This form of ownership is <strong>most appropriate between non-related parties</strong>, because each owner is able to keep their portion as a part of their estate and pass it on to heirs. It is also appropriate for passing property on to children. For example, by gifting property to children as Tenants in Common, the donor ensures that the interests of the children and their lineal descendants will be kept equitable. If one child dies, his/her interest will pass on to his/her lineal descendants. For this reason, this is also the most common means by which property is titled when it is to be distributed to children through a will.</p>

<p>An undivided interest is where each co-owner has an <em><strong>interest in the entire property</strong></em>, not just ownership of a piece of the property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if two individuals own an undivided interest in an acre of land, each owner has an ownership interest in the entire acre, rather than one owning the northern half and the other owning the southern half. Each owner, therefore, has the right to make use of the entire acre, not just a piece of it.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though two or more people own property as JTWROS, the rights of the parties may be limited, thus preventing a tenant from asserting ownership rights over his/her undivided share without the consent of the other joint owners. For example, a check payable to John and Mary as JTWROS may require both owners to endorse the check, and it is unlikely a bank would permit one party acting alone to endorse and claim half of the amount due.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>What happens when an owner dies?</em> <strong>His/her interest passes to the surviving co-owners.</strong> Although the phrase "with right of survivorship" is frequently added, this is merely for clarification and is not required. For example, if there were four owners, each with &frac14; interest in the property, then when one dies the other three co-owners would have 1/3 interest in the property.</p>
</li>
<li><em>When is this appropriate? </em> In common law states, it is <strong>most appropriate for married couples</strong> to title their home and checking accounts in this manner. Financial accounts are usually converted to this type of ownership by indicating the letters JTWROS (Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship). But its use in this manner might require that each spouse own property individually sufficient to optimize their use of the applicable credit amount. However, caution regarding JTWROS is in order for community property states, where it can be more advantageous for spouses to own property as community property or as "community property with right of survivorship" so that 100% of the property can get a step up in basis (rather than 50%) when one spouse dies.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>JTWROS can also be useful in passing property to the next generation, such as a surviving spouse titling property in Joint Tenancy with a son or daughter. But this later use makes the most sense when there is only one son or daughter. Where there is more than one child, it could result in <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer6','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>unequal distributions</strong></a> unless this is adjusted for in the will. Note that the gift of a cotenancy interest to anyone other than a spouse may have <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer7','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>adverse estate tax consequences</strong></a>.</p>

<h4>Adverse Estate Tax Consequence</h4>
<p>A gift of a cotenancy interest to a child or anyone other than a spouse may incur gift tax, subject to the facts and circumstances of each case. This will be discussed in detail later in this course.</p>
<p>However, the gift of a cotenancy interest to anyone other than a spouse may cause inclusion of the value of the gift in donor&rsquo;s gross estate. The value included in the donor&rsquo;s gross estate is generally the date of death value, not the value when the gift occurred. If significant appreciation occurs from the date of the gift to the donor&rsquo;s death, this has the potential for increasing estate taxes of the deceased donor. Remember that the property itself will not be in donor&rsquo;s gross estate (the donor&rsquo;s cotenancy passes by operation of law to the surviving cotenants) but the value of the property will be. In effect, the executor of the donor&rsquo;s estate may have to find cash to pay estate taxes on an asset that the estate does not own. Additional information on this topic is provided later in this lesson.</p>
