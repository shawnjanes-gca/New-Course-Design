<p>Even if you do not live in a community property state, it is important to remember that when married couples move from a community property state, any property they acquired as community property will retain its status as community property. Furthermore, any property that is purchased with community property assets will itself become community property, even though the property purchased is not located in a community property state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Example.</em></strong> James and Ethyl Gilmore moved from California to Tennessee. Prior to moving, they sold the California home they purchased when they first got married. Although there was an outstanding balance on the mortgage, the difference in the cost of living made it possible for them to pay cash for their new house in Tennessee. Because the house is purchased with community property assets, the Tennessee house will be treated as community property, even though Tennessee is a non-community property state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a similar fashion, if a couple moves from a non-community property state into a community property state, the property they acquired prior to the move will retain its character (as separate property, joint tenancy, etc.) and does not automatically become community property.</p>
