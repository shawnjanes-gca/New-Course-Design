  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Origin and Scope of Community Property</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Thus far, this course has focused primarily on types of co-ownership derived from &quot;common law,&quot; meaning they are derived from property laws of England. But a small number of states derive their property ownership laws from Spanish law, which has particular impact for married couples. These states are known as &quot;community property&quot; states, and include:</p>
  <p>Alaska (optional)<br>
Arizona<br>
California <br>
Idaho <br>
Louisiana <br>
Nevada <br>
New Mexico <br>
Texas <br>
Washington <br>
Wisconsin</p>
  <p>As can be seen by the map, these states do not cover much of the continental United States. Yet it is important to have some awareness of community property, even if you do not live in a community property state because the impact of community property laws is not confined to these 10 states. Furthermore, other states are considering community property laws, so the list may grow.</p>
