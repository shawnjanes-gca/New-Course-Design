  <h1><span class="pagetitle">The Nature of Community Property</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>In a nutshell, here is the key difference between the community property states and common law states:</p>

  
  <div class="imageLeft"><img src="greene/joint_property/images/The_Nature_of_Community_Property_01.svg" width="201" height="295" alt=""/></div>
  <div class="imageRight">

  <div class="clearfix"></div>
  <p>With certain exceptions, everything received by a husband and wife while residing in a community property state is considered to be owned 50-50. While this seems consistent with the outcome of most divorce settlement cases in common law states, where assets are frequently split 50-50, such similarity has more to do with the court seeking an equitable solution than with property law. Â Note: In Alaska, rather than community property being the default position for spouses, the spouses must opt for community property treatment.</p>
  <h3>Examples of Community Property</h3>
  <p>All of the following are community property:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Salaries earned by either spouse during marriage. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Items purchased with money earned by either spouse during      marriage. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Income generated by community property. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>In some states, income generated by separate property.</strong> Texas      is an example of a state where this is the case. </li>
    <li><strong>Commingled purchases and accounts.</strong> It is possible to purchase      property or open accounts with a combination of community funds and      separate funds, and have a representative portion retain its character as      separate property. But if the funds have become so commingled that it is      no longer possible to distinguish them, then everything becomes community      property. This is why good records can be so important. </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Exceptions to Community Property</h3>
<p>The following are exceptions to community property, whereby each spouse owns property separately from the other spouse, which will be 100% included in the estate of the individual spouse owning it:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Property acquired prior      to marriage. </strong>However it was titled before marriage, as solely owned or      jointly owned, it retains the same status after marriage. </li>
  <li><strong>Property acquired prior      to moving into a community property state.</strong> If a couple moves into a      community property state from a non-community property state, then any      property acquired prior to the move will generally retain its prior      status.</li>
  <li><strong>Gifts and inheritances      to one spouse during marriage.</strong> If the gift or inheritance is      specifically to one spouse and not the other, then the property retains      its status as gifted or inherited. </li>
  <li><strong>Compensation for      personal injuries during marriage. </strong>Such compensation is generally      treated as separate property. </li>
  <li><strong>Property purchased      during marriage with separate property</strong> will itself be separate      property. </li>
  <li><strong>In some states, income      generated by separate property.</strong> California is an example of a state      where this is the case.</li></ul>
