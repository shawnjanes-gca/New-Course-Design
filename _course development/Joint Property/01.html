      <p>Understand the estate tax implications of jointly held property.</p>
      <p>Identify when the use of jointly held property might complement or undermine an estate plan.</p>

  <p>Used prudently, jointly held property can be one of the simplest and most expedient methods of transferring assets at death. In some cases, it is a type of transfer that takes place as an operation of law, which sometimes completely bypasses the probate process. But if its features are ignored or improperly used in the estate planning process, it can significantly undermine the estate plan. It is, therefore, important to have a basic understanding of the features of joint property.</p>
