  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Potential Gift Tax Consequences</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>If, when creating joint property, any co-owner receives an interest in the property that is greater than his/her contribution to its purchase, then the overage may be considered a gift. This is not a problem if the co-owners are married, due to the unlimited marital deduction. But if they are not married, and the amount of the &quot;gift&quot; is over the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Gift Tax Exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2016, an individual can make gifts of up to $14,000 to any individual with no gift tax consequences; spouses can split gifts for a combined $28,000 to any individual, regardless of the source of the funds. These amounts will be adjusted for inflation in future years, but only as inflation increases the exclusion by thousand dollar increments.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">annual gift tax exclusion<strong>,</strong></a> then a taxable gift may take place in the creation of the joint ownership, in which case the person making the gift will need to file a gift tax return.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> Bill and his son John are purchasing property as Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship. The property is valued at $100,000. Bill is contributing $80,000 and his son is contributing $20,000. Per the laws of that state, they each have an enforceable right to half the property, so Bill is essentially giving John an interest in the property that is $30,000 over and beyond John's contribution. Since this is beyond the $14,000 annual gift tax exclusion ($28,000 if Bill and his wife are splitting the gift), a taxable gift results from the transaction.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:50px;"><strong><em>What if Bill and his wife had given John $20,000 last year, and John is going to use that prior gift to bring his contribution on the purchase up to $40,000.</em></strong> The fact that the source of the funds was a gift in a prior year is immaterial. Since Bill and his wife could split the gift, it was not a taxable gift. The money then became John's to do with as he pleased. With the current transaction, John is now only receiving a gift of $10,000 and a taxable gift does not occur.</p>
  <p>Whether or not a gift occurs upon titling the joint property with a non-spouse will depend upon the rights of each tenant under local law.  Generally speaking, when adding a non-spouse to a bank account, titled as JTWROS, no gift occurs when adding the non-spouse to the account.  This is true because with such accounts the creator of the account is generally free to withdraw the funds and close the account at any time with no recourse by the person who was added to the account.  However, whenever the non-spouse withdraws funds from the account for his or her own benefit, then a gift occurs at the time of withdrawal.</p>
  <p>When titling property such as real estate or a stock certificate as JTWROS with a non-spouse who did not contribute (or contributed less) to its purchase, then a gift generally takes place at the time of titling.  In contrast to a bank account, one party would not be able to own the asset entirely outright without the other party formally surrendering his or her interest.  Again, state law will have to be consulted to make that determination, and it is best that the client consult with his or her estate planning attorney or tax advisor before taking such action.</p>
