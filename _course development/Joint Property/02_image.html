  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Types of Jointly Owned Property</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>There are four types of co-ownership of property, which are listed below. For each of them, it is important to have knowledge of the following points:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The number of permissible      owners </li>
    <li>The relationship of      owners, if any </li>
    <li>The nature of each      person's ownership </li>
    <li>What happens when an owner      dies </li>
    <li>Appropriate use of this type of ownership.</li>
  </ul>

              <li>What is the relationship      of the owners?  <strong>None required,      but they may be related.</strong></li>
              <li>What is the extent of each      person's ownership interest?  <strong>Each      co-owner has an equal,</strong> <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undivided Interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An undivided interest is where each co-owner has an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;interest in the entire property&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, not just ownership of a piece of the property.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, if two individuals own an undivided interest in an acre of land, each owner has an ownership interest in the entire acre, rather than one owning the northern half and the other owning the southern half. Each owner, therefore, has the right to make use of the entire acre, not just a piece of it.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">undivided interest</a>.      If there are two owners, they each own ½. If there are three owners, they      each own 1/3.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even though two or more people own property as JTWROS, the rights of the parties may be limited, thus preventing a tenant from asserting ownership rights over his/her undivided share without the consent of the other joint owners.  For example, a check payable to John and Mary as JTWROS may require both owners to endorse the check, and it is unlikely a bank would permit one party acting alone to endorse and claim half of the amount due.</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><em>What happens when an      owner dies? </em> <strong>His/her interest      passes to the surviving co-owners.</strong> Although the phrase &quot;with      right of survivorship&quot; is frequently added, this is merely for      clarification and is not required. For example, if there were four owners,      each with ¼ interest in the property, then when one dies the other three      co-owners would have 1/3 interest in the property. </li>
              <li><em>When is this      appropriate? </em> In common law      states, it is <strong>most appropriate for married couples</strong> to title their      home and checking accounts in this manner. Financial accounts are usually      converted to this type of ownership by indicating the letters JTWROS      (Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship). But its use in this manner      might require that each spouse own property individually sufficient to      optimize their use of the applicable credit amount. However, caution      regarding JTWROS is in order for community property states, where it can      be more advantageous for spouses to own property as community property or      as &ldquo;community property with right of survivorship&rdquo; so that 100% of the property      can get a step up in basis (rather than 50%) when one spouse dies.<strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
JTWROS can also be useful in passing property to the next generation, such as a surviving spouse titling property in Joint Tenancy with a son or daughter. But this later use makes the most sense when there is only one son or daughter. Where there is more than one child, it could result in <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of Unequal Distributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mary was married to John at his death. They have two daughters, Jane and Helen.  Following John&rsquo;s death, Mary titled property JTWROS with herself, Jane, and Helen as cotenants (co-owners).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;When Mary dies, Mary&rsquo;s 1/3 interest passes equally to Jane and Helen.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Jane and Helen become 50% cotenants in the JTWROS after Mary&rsquo;s death.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Assume Jane dies next.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Jane&rsquo;s 50% of the JTWROS passes to Helen.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Helen now owns 100% of the property.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">unequal distributions</a> unless this is adjusted for in the will. Note that the gift of a cotenancy interest to anyone other than a spouse may have <a href="#" title=" &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse Estate Tax Consequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A gift of a cotenancy interest to a child or anyone other than a spouse may incur gift tax, subject to the facts and circumstances of each case. This will be discussed in detail later in this course.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, the gift of a cotenancy interest to anyone other than a spouse may cause inclusion of the value of the gift in donor&rsquo;s gross estate. The value included in the donor&rsquo;s gross estate is generally the date of death value, not the value when the gift occurred. If significant appreciation occurs from the date of the gift to the donor&rsquo;s death, this has the potential for increasing estate taxes of the deceased donor. Remember that the property itself will not be in donor&rsquo;s gross estate (the donor&rsquo;s cotenancy passes by operation of law to the surviving cotenants) but the value of the property will be. In effect, the executor of the donor&rsquo;s estate may have to find cash to pay estate taxes on an asset that the estate does not own. Additional information on this topic is provided later in this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a high level summary presented to raise awareness and is not intended to address all potential considerations.

              <li><em>What is the extent of      each person's ownership?</em> <strong>Each person holds a percentage interest in      the property, the size of which can vary among the co-owners.</strong> Usually,      their ownership interest is proportional to their contribution to the      purchase of the property. Here too, their interest in the property is      undivided. </li>
              <li><em>What happens when one      owner dies? </em>This type of ownership does not bypass probate, unless it      is held in trust. Nor does the owner's interest terminate at death. <strong>While      alive, each owner has the right to transfer his/her percentage interest at      any time, to whomever they wish, independently of the other owners. In      like manner, at death, their interest will be distributed according to the      terms of their will. </strong></li>
              <li><em>When is it appropriate?</em> This form of ownership is <strong>most appropriate between non-related parties</strong>, because each owner is able to keep their portion as a part of their estate and pass it on to heirs. It is also appropriate for passing property on to children. For example, by gifting property to children as Tenants in Common, the donor ensures that the interests of the children and their lineal descendants will be kept equitable. If one child dies, his/her interest will pass on to his/her lineal descendants. For this reason, this is also the most common means by which property is titled when it is to be distributed to children through a will.          </li>

              <li>What happens when one      owner dies?  <strong>Community Property      is subject to probate. </strong>When one spouse dies, their half interest in      the property will be distributed as instructed in the will. </li>
              <li>When is this appropriate? In most states, this is not so much a question of appropriateness as it is of state law.  In other words, <strong>property acquired by a married couple in most community property states, unless it is a gift or inheritance, or unless it is purchased with assets acquired prior to marriage, becomes Community Property. However, this is not automatic in Alaska, where couples must opt for Community Property treatment.</strong>          </li>
