  </h1>
  <p>There is no escaping The Rule unless one limits his or her practice to taxable accounts. Yet, even that approach may not be a viable long-term strategy as the SEC gears up to strengthen its version of a fiduciary standard of care. </p>
  <p>This will then leave FINRA as the lone regulator without a fiduciary standard of care. The pressure upon FINRA could then mount to migrate to its own fiduciary duty of care. The fiduciary imperative may spread to even taxable accounts in the foreseeable future. </p>
  <p>This course is designed to give you a solid foundation in the key aspects of The Rule; The next courses in our program will use that foundation to help you transition and thrive as a Fiduciary Advisor.</p>
