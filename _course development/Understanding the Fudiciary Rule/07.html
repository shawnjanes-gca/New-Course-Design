  <p>Fiduciary Advisors are generally prohibited from offering conflicted advice. The DOL refers to prohibitions such as these as prohibited transactions. Offering conflicted advice under The Rule is a prohibited transaction unless an exemption applies.</p>
<p>The DOL has the power to establish both prohibited transactions and prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs).  The following PTEs, fully explained in the subsequent discussion, permit advisors to offer or avoid conflicted advice: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Full Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE) [S<em>ometimes referred to as a BIC</em>]</li>
  <li>BIC lite - Level Fee Fiduciary Exemption (LFFE)</li>
  <li>Grandfathered Exemption (GE)</li>
  <li>Other Exemptions  </li>
</ul>
  <p>And so forth...</p>
