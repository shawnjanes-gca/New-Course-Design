  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Full Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
  <h3>Purpose</h3><p>The Full BICE allows variable compensation to a Fiduciary Advisor, financial institution, and/or affiliate of the financial institution arising from recommendations to Retail Retirement Investors. Without the authority of the Full BICE, variable compensation would be a prohibited transaction subject to penalties. </p></div>
<p>Is the Full BICE a panacea for continuing business as usual during the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; before The Rule?  Hardly! The Full BICE comes with sobering financial risk to both the advisor and the financial institution. As but one example of risk, IRA clients now have the right to file class action lawsuits against advisors and financial institutions for charging fees in excess of reasonable fees.   </p>
<p>The Full BICE is designed for ongoing relationships and serves to formalize the DOL&rsquo;s imperative to make advice client-centric instead of advisor-centric. </p>
  <p>You will see references to both “BICE” and “BIC” in the discussion that follows. “BICE” refers to a regulatory <strong>exemption</strong><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup> created by the DOL as part of The Rule. A BIC is merely a <strong>document</strong>; It is a written, signed<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup>, and legally binding contract between a financial institution and Retail Retirement Investor. A BIC must contain the following provisions:</p>
  <p>Accordion with Tab Menus</p>
  <p>How will regulators track compliance with these BICE requirements? Compliance will be tracked in the same way as all other government requirements, i.e., documentation and lots of it! Warranties, disclosures, DOL notices, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements must be documented thoroughly.</p>
  <p>No discussion of the BICE would be complete without a review of the &ldquo;Thou shalt nots.&rdquo; A BICE may NOT be used in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Fiduciary Advisor has discretionary control over ERISA plan or IRA assets.</li>
    <li>Offering conflicted advice through a &ldquo;Robo&rdquo; advisor 3 </li>
    <li>Conducting transactions between the Fiduciary Advisor personally and an ERISA plan or IRA</li>
  </ul>
  Attempting to limit the rights of the IRA Retail Retirement Investor4 to participate in a class action lawsuit, limit the amount that can be recovered under the suit, or place burdensome restrictions on the right to arbitration

    <p><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup>Technically referred to as “Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2016-01” by the DOL.</p>
    <p><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup>A signed BIC is required from IRA clients only.  A signed BIC is not required of ERISA plan clients but written disclosure of fiduciary status and adoption of policies designed to comply with the impartial conduct standards are required; these disclosures are referred to informally as the Disclosure BIC. </p>
    <p><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">3</sup> Prudence under The Rule is defined almost verbatim as prudence under the original 1974 ERISA statutes.</p>
    <p><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">4</sup>3 A Robo advisor that steers clients to high commission and/or proprietary products may not be eligible for the BICE.</p>
    <p><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">5</sup>4 These provisions will generally apply predominantly to IRA Retail Retirement Investors.  ERISA requires an even higher standard for ERISA plan participants.</p>
