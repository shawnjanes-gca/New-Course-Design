  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Full Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The Full BICE allows the payment of variable compensation to a Fiduciary Advisor, financial institution, and/or affiliate of the financial institution arising from recommendations to Retail Retirement Investors. Without the authority of the Full BICE, variable compensation would be a prohibited transaction subject to penalties. </p></div>
<p>Is the Full BICE a panacea for continuing business as usual during the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; before The Rule?  Hardly! The Full BICE comes with sobering financial risk to both the advisor and the financial institution. As but one example of risk, IRA clients now have the right to file class action lawsuits against advisors and financial institutions for charging fees in excess of reasonable fees.   </p>
<p>The Full BICE is designed for ongoing relationships and serves to formalize the DOL&rsquo;s imperative to make advice client-centric instead of advisor-centric. </p>
  <p>You will see references to both “BICE” and “BIC” in the discussion that follows. “BICE” refers to a regulatory <strong>exemption</strong><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup> created by the DOL as part of The Rule. A BIC is merely a <strong>document</strong> containing the provisions required by the BICE. It is a written, signed<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup>, and legally binding contract between a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Institution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Financial Institution” should be interpreted broadly and includes, but is not limited to, RIAs, broker/dealers, banks, and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">financial institution</a> and Retail Retirement Investor. A BIC must contain the following provisions:</p>

                            <p>Recommendations must be based upon what is best for the client, not what makes the most money for the Fiduciary Advisor or financial institution. </p>
                            <p>The intimidating term “best” in this context is not absolute.  An advisor need not evaluate every financial product from every financial product provider.  <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prudence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Prudent Standard” is defined by the DOL as “[acting] with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use … without regard to the financial…interests of the Advisor, Financial Institution, or any affiliate…” &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Prudence</a><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">3</sup>, not perfection, is required.  By implication, a prudent recommendation requires a thorough knowledge of the client’s goals and financial profile. Thus, an element of financial planning may be required.</p>

                            <p>Excessive compensation is the DOL’s target with the reasonable compensation requirement. The Rule does NOT set advisor fees, but rather establishes principles-based guidelines within which fees must fall. As but one example, variable compensation paid to Fiduciary Advisors should be based upon “neutral factors” such as length of the sales cycle or expertise required to sell and service the investment. </p>
                            <p>The DOL admonishes Fiduciary Advisors to provide services commensurate with fees; the long-term result may be an evolution to service-based fee models and away from commission-based fee models.</p>
                            <div class="example-box">
                              <h3>Example – Services Commensurate with Fees</h3>
                              <p>Fees may take into account advisor experience, credentials, and scope of services provided.  Consider these two advisors:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>A CFP® professional with 30 years of experience meets with her client monthly and provides comprehensive financial planning services in addition to investment management services. </li>
                                <li>A non-credentialed advisor with 3 years of experience meets with his client annually and provides only investment management services.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Between these two advisors, the CFP® professional would generally be justified in charging a higher fee.   </p>
                            </div>
                            <!-- example-box -->
                            <p>An example of service-based pricing can be found in the hotel industry. The Ritz-Carlton provides premium service at premium prices to a discriminating clientele, while Super 8 caters to budget-conscious travelers seeking a basic room at modest cost.</p>
						<p>	How do we determine if fees are “reasonable?” A comparison of advisor fees, experience, credentials and services provided to fees for similar services provided by other advisors may be used to establish reasonable fees. This process is referred to as “benchmarking.”</p>
                          </div>
                        </div>

                            <p>This could also be called the “no secrets” requirement and is best illustrated by example:</p>

                           	  <p>Indexed Annuities were once advertised as “no fee” products. If a Fiduciary Advisor is paid commissions on the sale of such annuities, the term “no fee” may be deemed misleading under The Rule.</p>
