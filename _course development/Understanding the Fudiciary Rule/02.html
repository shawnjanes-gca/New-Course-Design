    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Your legal duty to clients may have skyrocketed and your ability to earn unrestricted compensation may have plummeted as a result of the Fiduciary Rule (The Rule).  Advisors subject to The Rule may be considered <a href="#">fiduciary</a> advisors and must act in the best interests of their clients. </p>
  <p>Understanding whether or not you are a Fiduciary <a href="#">Advisor </a>and, if so, how that impacts your practice is critical for the very survival, if not the growth, of your business.  A Fiduciary Advisor is simply a covered advisor making a covered recommendation. We will explain that deceptively simple definition in the pages that follow.</p>
