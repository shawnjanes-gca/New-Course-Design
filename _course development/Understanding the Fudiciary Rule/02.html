  </h1>
  <p>Your legal duty to clients may have skyrocketed and your ability to earn unrestricted compensation may have plummeted as a result of the Fiduciary Rule (The Rule).  Advisors subject to The Rule may be considered <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiduciary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fiduciary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; standard of care imposes a legal obligation to put a client’s best interest above that of the advisor and the advisor’s firm. A great deal of this course is dedicated to exploring fiduciary responsibilities and the best interest impact under The Rule.  As but one example of this heightened standard of care, variable compensation (i.e., commissions) based upon sales of financial products may be prohibited or restricted because of their potential for creating a conflict of interest." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">fiduciary</a> advisors and must act in the best interests of their clients. </p>
  <p>Understanding whether or not you are a Fiduciary <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advisor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Credentials, job title, and job function no longer matter in determining if you are an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;An advisor need not even have a pulse! A computer (&ldquo;Robo&rdquo; advisor) program can be considered an advisor under some circumstances.  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Persons with or without professional designations (e.g., CFP® Professional, Certified Personal Retirement Planning SpecialistTM, CPA, CFA® and others) may be advisors.  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;An advisor may function in any number of roles, including financial planner, annuity consultant, insurance advisor, or investment manager. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Note that even advisors not subject to FINRA licensing or state securities/insurance licensing may be considered advisors under The Rule. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" >Advisor </a>and, if so, how that impacts your practice is critical for the very survival, if not the growth, of your business.  A Fiduciary Advisor is simply a covered advisor making a covered recommendation. We will explain that deceptively simple definition in the pages that follow.</p>
