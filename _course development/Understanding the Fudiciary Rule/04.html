  <p>A covered recommendation is any communication in which a covered advisor (1) earns <strong>compensation</strong> as a result of (2) providing <strong>investment advice</strong> to (3) a <strong>Retail Retirement Investor</strong>.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup> A covered recommendation is made only when an advisor satisfies all three of these conditions. </p>

              <p>The term &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; in this context includes direct compensation from the client and indirect compensation from third party sources. Neither variable compensation nor third party compensation is permitted unless an exemption applies.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup></p>
              <p>Variable compensation is simply compensation that varies based upon the type or amount of financial product sold: examples include up front commissions, trailing commissions, deferred sales charges, and 12(b)-1 fees.</p>
              <p>The term “third party compensation” is any compensation from sources other than the client and includes <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment product providers such as mutual funds may pay a broker/ dealer  to obtain preferential access to the firm’s advisors. For example, assume a client pays an annual fee to the mutual fund of 75 basis points (0.75%). Revenue sharing occurs if the mutual fund  then pays a portion of the 75 basis points back to the broker/ dealer. &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">revenue sharing</a>, <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft Dollar Arrangements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A broker/dealer may receive payments from a mutual fund to defray a portion of  investment research costs. Only broker/dealers directing client investments to the mutual fund would generally receive these soft dollars. The more assets the broker/dealer places with the mutual fund, the higher the soft dollar payout. Soft dollars are the financial equivalent of airline frequent flyer miles. &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">soft dollar arrangements</a>, and other indirect payments.</p>

              <p>The advisability of buying, selling, holding, or otherwise managing an investment (including ERISA plan and IRA rollovers) is investment advice. When you communicate that advice to a client you have made a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations are calls to action. Examples of recommendations follow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Full or partial rollover from a 401(k) to an IRA or from one IRA to another IRA&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Take distributions from any ERISA plan or IRA &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Create or change an investment policy statement or portfolio allocation&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Buy, sell, hold, or hedge  securities &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Select another person to provide investment advice &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" >recommendation</a>. Even advice to change an existing investment relationship from brokerage (commission based) to advisory (flat fee or flat percentage based) may be considered a recommendation.</p>
              <p>In contrast, communications of a general nature, for purely educational purposes, pursuant to a generalized allocation model, or as a platform provider will not generally rise to the level of a recommendation. </p>
              <div class="example-box"> <h3>Example</h3><p>A general newsletter to all clients discussing the current economic cycle and analyzing potential interest rate changes is generally not considered investment advice. Purely educational communications, such as methods to reduce capital gains taxes, would not generally be a recommendation.  However, if the communication includes specific investment advice, it may be viewed as a recommendation.</p>

              <p>The Rule is designed to protect individual (Retail) Retirement Investors rather than sophisticated institutional retirement investors. Using this principle as guidance, DOL identifies “[ERISA] plan participants and beneficiaries<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">3</sup> …[and] <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in the context of The Rule includes participants, owners, or beneficiaries in IRAs (including Traditional, Roth, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs), Health Savings Accounts, and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. College savings 529 Plan participants and donors are NOT covered by The Rule. &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">IRA</a> owners as [Retail] Retirement Investors.” Notably, owners and beneficiaries of taxable accounts are not considered Retail Retirement Investors. </p>
              <p>Here is one big change – participants in self-directed 401(k) plans (including those using a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brokerage Window&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;brokerage window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; allows self-directed 401(k) Plan participants to choose from a broad range of mutual funds, ETFs, and other investments not included in the plan’s official menu of investment choices. &lt;/p&gt; " class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">brokerage window</a>) are now Retail Retirement Investors which, in turn, may lead to Fiduciary Advisor status. Before The Rule, advisors to these very same participants may have been exempted from fiduciary status.</p>
