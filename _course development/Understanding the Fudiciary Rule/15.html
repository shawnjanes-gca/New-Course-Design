  <h3>Legal Risk</h3>
  <p>You can recommend virtually any financial product under The Rule and its related exemptions. There is no list of &ldquo;prohibited investments.&rdquo; Good news, right?  Before you answer, consider that your recommendations must be in the best interests of your client. That mandate includes your responsibility to make only prudent recommendations and charge reasonable fees. Yet, you have no absolute assurance that a recommendation is prudent or fees are reasonable when you make the recommendation!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here&rsquo;s a chilling consequence of The Rule - the ultimate arbiter of &ldquo;prudent&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; could well be a judge as a result of litigation against you and your firm. It gets worse…  </li>
    <li>In these United States of America, a person charged with a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty. In stark contrast, there is no presumption of innocence under The Rule. The burden of proof is upon you and your financial institution to prove the prudence of your recommendations and reasonableness of your fees.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although binding arbitration may be required of IRA Retail Retirement Investors, those same investors may file class action lawsuits against Fiduciary Advisors and financial institutions. </p>
  <p>How serious can legal risk become? Here is but one example - Boeing paid $57MM to settle a long-standing DOL lawsuit alleging excessive fees in Boeing’s 401(k) Plan.</p>
  <h3>Penalties</h3>
  <p>Penalties of 15% per prohibited transaction may be levied. The penalties may increase dramatically if the Retail Retirement Investor is not timely restored to the financial position they were in before the prohibited transaction. </p>
  <p>No problem - the financial institution will pay, right?  Wrong answer! Penalties may be assessed against the Fiduciary Advisor personally.</p>
