  <p>A meteor 8 miles across struck Earth some 65 million years ago, causing the mass extinction of the dinosaurs and most other species. Surprisingly, a number of the surviving species actually thrived as they adjusted to the post-impact environment.</p>
  <p>The Department of Labor (DOL) unleashed its own meteor with the release of the “Conflict of Interest Rule in Retirement Investment Advice” on April 6, 2016.  This rule, commonly referred to as the Fiduciary Rule, was a seismic blow to commissioned-based advisors to IRAs and ERISA plans. Those advisors who adjust to the post-Fiduciary Rule environment have the opportunity to thrive; those who do not may struggle just to survive. </p>
  <p>Our mission in this course is to help you understand the DOL’s intent by analyzing key portions of the +1,000-page Fiduciary Rule. Your solid understanding will serve you well in the practice management courses (Transition and Thrive) that follow this course. The objectives displayed to the right represent our approach to this mission.</p>
