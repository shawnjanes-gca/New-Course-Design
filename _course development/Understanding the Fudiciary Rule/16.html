  <h1><span class="pagetitle">The Three-Ring Circus of Regulators</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Once upon a time an advisor’s investment duty of care to clients was governed almost exclusively by their role within the separate rings of the regulatory circus:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>FINRA governed <a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_1" class="p7TTM_trg" title="<p><strong>Registered Representatives</strong></p>
<p>A person completing a FINRA application, initial licensing examination(s), and ongoing requirements is referred to as a “Registered Representative.”</p>">Registered Representatives</a></li>
    <li>The SEC (or a State) governed <a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_2" class="p7TTM_trg" title="<p><strong>Investment Advisor</strong></p>
<p>An advisor in the business of providing investment advice for compensation is generally deemed an Investment Advisor (IA) subject to regulation by the SEC. An IA must register with the SEC (or a state securities regulatory agency) and is then referred to as a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA).</p>
">Investment Advisors</a></li>
    <li>The DOL governed ERISA plans  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The chart below summarizes how the regulatory circus has changed under The Rule.</p>

                <h3>Before the Rule</h3>
                <p>Registered Representatives were historically held to a Suitability Standard (SS) for all account types; No fiduciary standard was imposed upon their dealings with owners and beneficiaries of taxable accounts, IRAs, or self-directed 401(k) Plans. <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA informs us that suitability “...requires that a firm or associated person have a reasonable basis to believe a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving a security or securities is suitable for the customer. This is based on the information obtained through reasonable diligence of the firm or associated person to ascertain the customer’s investment profile.”&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">Suitability</a> focuses upon the appropriateness of an investment, but does NOT forbid conflicts of interest or variable compensation.</p>
                <h3>After The Rule</h3>
                <p>Recommendations concerning IRA’s, self-directed 401(k) plans, and ERISA plans must not only be suitable, but must be made in the best interests of the client. Taxable accounts are not held to the DOL’s best interest standard but remain subject to the Suitability Standard.</p>

                <h3>Before The Rule</h3>
                <p>Investment Advisors (IAs) provide investment advisory services, usually under a fixed fee arrangement such as a fixed percentage of assets under management. IA&rsquo;s were held to the SEC&rsquo;s version of the fiduciary standard and owed the following fiduciary duties to clients:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>&ldquo;…a fundamental obligation to act in the best interests of your clients…&rdquo; </li>
                  <li>&ldquo;…a duty of undivided loyalty and utmost good faith.&rdquo; </li>
                  <li>A duty &ldquo;… not [to] engage in any activity in conflict with the interest of any client…&rdquo; </li>
                  <li>A duty to &ldquo; … avoid misleading clients and …[to] …provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts to … clients and prospective clients.&rdquo; </li>
                  <li>A duty to &ldquo;…eliminate, or at least disclose, all conflicts of interest…&rdquo; </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>After The Rule</h3>
                <p>IAs are subject to both the SEC and the DOL (The Rule) when advising Retail Retirement Investors. The Rule does not apply to IA’s advising taxable accounts.</p>
                <p>IAs charging reasonable level fees with no additional direct or indirect compensation will feel a less severe impact under The Rule. Why? The SEC’s Fiduciary Standard and the DOL’s Fiduciary Standard are generally similar. However, the following example illustrates just one of the differences.</p>
                <div class="example-box"><h3>Example</h3>
                	<p>The Rule permits NO conflicts of interest without an exemption (i.e., BICE), while minimum compliance with the SEC standard allows conflicts of interest if the conflict is disclosed.</p>

                <h3>Before The Rule</h3>
                <p>ERISA plans were historically the primary retirement savings strategy for most Americans. The DOL, through the original 1974 ERISA statute, imposed a fiduciary standard on certain advisors to ERISA plans.</p>
                <p>An advisor receiving a fee for managing ERISA plan assets was considered a fiduciary under ERISA. The fiduciary then became an Investment Advice Fiduciary if they met <strong><u>all</u></strong> of the tests in a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-Part Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 5-part test required the advisor to (1) make recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities (2) on a regular basis (3) pursuant to a mutual understanding that the advice (4) would be the primary basis for investment decisions, and (5) the advice was individualized to the plan. It was not uncommon for an advisor to avoid Investment Advice Fiduciary status by claiming the advice was not regular or was not the primary basis for the investment.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">5-part test</a>. An Investment Advice Fiduciary was subject to the prohibited transaction rules.</p>
                <h3>After The Rule</h3>
                <p>The 1974 ERISA statute did not generally consider advisors to self-directed ERISA plans (ex. 401(k) brokerage windows) and IRAs subject to fiduciary status.</p>
                <p>However, IRA&rsquo;s and 401(k) plans ascended to parity, if not prominence, during the 42 years between ERISA and The Rule.</p>
				<p>Accordingly, the DOL became more focused upon IRA&rsquo;s and 401(k) plans; The original 5-part ERISA test is eliminated and replaced by the Fiduciary Advisor test under The Rule. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A covered advisor making covered recommendations to ERISA plan participants or IRA owners is a Fiduciary Advisor fully subject to The Rule.</li>
                </ul>
               <p> Receipt of variable compensation by a Fiduciary Advisor after the applicability date is now a Prohibited Transaction and may only be received under a Prohibited Transaction Exemption.</p>

  </div>
<p>One regulator, the IRS, is conspicuously absent. The IRS has its own prohibited transaction regulations that closely resemble ERISA regulations. The IRS has historically policed both IRA and ERISA plan fiduciaries through the assessment of penalties; That role is expected to continue under The Rule.</p>
