  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Performance Analytics: Absolute Returns Analysis</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The first and most basic level of performance analytics is <em><strong>assessing absolute portfolio returns</strong></em>.  The relevance of absolute returns is best summed up in the following interchange between an 82-year-old retiree and his advisor.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:35px;">The advisor, aware of the fact that the older gentleman would be concerned with the decline in his portfolio stated, “I know you are concerned that your portfolio has decreased in value by 10% since last year, but the market was down over 18% during this period, so we actually did very well.” To which the gentleman replied, “You may be right son, but I still have less to spend at the grocery store.”  </p>
  <p>This interchange defines the relevance of the absolute returns perspective; however, assessing absolute returns in a vacuum is ineffective in truly understanding the value an advisor is adding in the portfolio management process.  </p>
  <div class="example-box"> In 2015, a large-cap equity mutual fund posted a return of 3%.  How would you rate this return?<p><span class="pageInstruction">Click a choice below to rate this return.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:125px;"><a href="#" title="&lt;strong&gt;Correct.&lt;/strong&gt; While a return of 3% is obviously lower than the 25-year average, and would be a low return in many individual years, in 2015 the S&amp;P lost 0.73% to its value from year-end 2014. Therefore, the absolute return is above the appropriate benchmark, meaning that the fund actually over-performed. However, this is not the case in every year. In 2014, for example, the S&amp;P returned 11.4%. Had this fund returned 3% in 2014, it would have “under-performed.”" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Good</a></span><span style="margin-left:225px;"><a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_2" class="p7TTM_trg" title="<strong>Incorrect.</strong> While a return of 3% is obviously lower than the 25-year average, and would be a low return in many individual years, in 2015 the S&P lost 0.73% to its value from year-end 2014.
