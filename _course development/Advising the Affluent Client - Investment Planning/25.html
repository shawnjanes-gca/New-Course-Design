<p>Tangible evidence of the impact of undisciplined decision-making is found in a study conducted by the University of California-Davis.&nbsp; The study tracked over 900,000 trades that were made by individuals on an unsolicited basis through a discount broker.&nbsp; It found that, on average, those stocks individuals sold went up relative to the market (outperformed the market) <strong><em>after</em></strong> they were sold.&nbsp; Likewise, the stocks individuals bought went down relative to the market (underperformed the market) <strong><em>after</em></strong> they were purchased.&nbsp; In summary, individuals tended to act on their emotions, buying on greed when a security was performing well and selling on fear when a stock declined.</p>

<p>Discipline ensures that emotions do not unduly impact the process for buying and selling securities.&nbsp; By employing discipline, individuals can be more confident in their investment decisions, relying on factual information to support their decisions when short-term fluctuations may adversely affect their portfolio.&nbsp; This is not to say that simply having a discipline will ensure positive results.&nbsp; It will, however, serve to increase the effectiveness of investment decisions over time, while also minimizing short-term emotional stress.</p>
