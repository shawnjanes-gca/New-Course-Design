  <p>Tangible evidence of the impact of undisciplined decision-making is found in a study conducted by the University of California-Davis.  The study tracked over 900,000 trades that were made by individuals on an unsolicited basis through a discount broker.  It found that, on average, those stocks individuals sold went up relative to the market (outperformed the market) <strong>after</strong> they were sold.  Likewise, the stocks individuals bought went down relative to the market (underperformed the market) <strong>after</strong> they were purchased.  In summary, individuals tended to act on their emotions, buying on greed when a security was performing well and selling on fear when a stock declined.</p>

<p>Discipline ensures that emotions do not unduly impact the process for buying and selling securities.  By employing discipline, individuals can be more confident in their investment decisions, relying on factual information to support their decisions when short-term fluctuations may adversely affect their portfolio.  This is not to say that simply having a discipline will ensure positive results.  It will, however, serve to increase the effectiveness of investment decisions over time, while also minimizing short-term emotional stress.</p>
