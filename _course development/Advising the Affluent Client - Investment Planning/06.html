Most affluent individuals define risk as the amount of money that can be lost in an investment. However, that simplistic definition for risk is far too narrow and can lead to significant miscalculations in an investment plan. </p>
  <p> Let's examine the major types of risk, providing the framework for effectively addressing risk management in a more meaningful way.Â  </p>

              <p>Because the price of goods and services in the economy continue to rise, there is a constant erosion of purchasing power for each investor's assets. If a person fails to achieve a rate of return on capital that exceeds inflation, then the person is, in fact, losing purchasing power and lowering his or her net worth. Inflation risk is defined as the exposure to loss in purchasing power because of inflation.</p>

              <p>This is the most commonly used definition of investment risk. Most would classify this risk as the volatility in principal value of an investment over a certain period of time. Market risk also covers the potential risk of losing value in an investment because of depreciation in price.</p>

              <p>This is the most often overlooked risk, yet should be the most important when developing an investment plan. Outcome risk is defined as the risk of not achieving the desired quantitative outcome of the plan and thereby falling short of meeting a need or reaching an objective.</p>

  <p>Most investors understand inflation and the diminishing effect it has on investment returns. Likewise, most investors understand market risk, or volatility, and its effect on security price. To avoid market risk, investors often choose investments they believe to be "safer and more stable," such as money market securities and short-term bonds. But these "conservative" instruments historically have not produced the return needed to meet typical investment goals, like saving for retirement. Therefore, the investor, by seeking to avoid volatility or shorter-term market risk, is taking on another type of risk that often is not realized until time passes. This risk, "outcome risk," is the risk that the results of investing will be inadequate to meet long-term goals.  An effective question that will help you gauge your client's risk tolerance while also helping you understand the type of risk most important to manage for that client is:</p>
  <p><em class="explanation-widget-box">What is more important to you, limiting (or eliminating) potential ups and downs in your portfolio over any given year or the risk of not reaching your defined objectives (retire by the age of 65, etc.)?</em></p>
  <p>We will examine each of these three types of risk in greater detail on the pages that follow.</p>
