  <p>Asset allocation is the process for structuring a portfolio and managing it relative to the clientâ€™s objectives.  There are two general approaches to asset allocation: Strategic Asset Allocation and Tactical Asset Allocation</p>
  <p>Strategic Asset Allocation applies a long-term perspective to define how a portfolio should be diversified across asset classes. In this process, portfolios are not traded frequently, but are simply rebalanced periodically to maintain the desired asset allocation that is most likely to reach the longer-term objectives of the client. The chart below helps describe the process of strategic asset allocation.</p>

  Client Goals
The strategic asset allocation process focuses on the client's goals and long-term perspective, as well as the rebalancing of the portfolio. Before generating a mix of assets within a portfolio, there must be an understanding of the goals and expectations of the client. 
Being aware of such goals as the amount of risk willing to be taken, the amount of return desired and the time frame with which these goals can be reached, is essential in the strategic asset allocation process.

History of Asset Classes
The historical returns, volatility and future return expectations are the second primary inputs into a strategic asset allocation approach. The historical returns and volatility inputs are factual and cannot be debated. 
However, the averages used here can be significantly different depending on the time period chosen to determine these data inputs. Investors should be careful to utilize rational expectations and consider the impact of a lower return environment.

Portfolio Asset Mix
Taking into consideration the client's goals and the historical risk, return, and correlation of various asset classes, the strategic allocation process selects an asset allocation that is designed to meet the long-term objectives of the client.
