<p>One of the most common problems you will encounter when examining an individual's portfolio is a lack of clearly defined investment objectives.  In fact, most individuals will spend more time this year planning for their next vacation than they will spend developing a plan for how their portfolio will be managed.  Intuitively, individuals know they should develop such a plan and review it regularly, but most fail to act.  Most often, they simply have a general idea of why they are investing (such as for retirement or their children's education) but fail to map out a clear plan that includes:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Quantified return objectives</li>
    <li>Specific time horizon for      achieving each key objective</li>
    <li>Clear risk tolerance </li>
    <li>Well-defined guidelines      for portfolio asset allocation  </li>
    <li>Parameters for rebalancing      the portfolio</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unfortunately, studies indicate that over 75% of all high net worth investors have either an outdated investment plan or, worse, no written plan at all.  Most often you encounter individuals with 2 to 4 investment "relationships", none of which are coordinated with the others, resulting in a disjointed portfolio with no clear objectives or purpose.  The result is the equivalent of a ship without a rudder to steer it or a chart to map its course. </p>
  <p> Recognizing the importance of having a well-defined plan and clear investment objectives, the pages that follow provide a framework for establishing an effective investment plan for clients.</p>
