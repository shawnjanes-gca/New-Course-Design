  <p>Most individuals are aware of the fact that portfolio performance should be measured relative to an appropriate benchmark. Two valuable measures of how a portfolio/manager is performing relative to the benchmark are alpha and beta.  Although somewhat esoteric in their derivations, these statistics are commonly included in marketing literature; therefore, it is imperative that advisors are able to communicate the value of these metrics.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each of the links below to learn more about alpha and beta.</span></p>

              <p>Beta (β) is a measure of risk, quantifying a portfolio’s sensitivity to movements in a benchmark, such as the S&P 500. A beta greater than 1.0 means that the security or portfolio is more volatile than the benchmark, while a beta less than 1.0 means the asset or portfolio is less volatile than the benchmark.  To understand more about how beta is utilized, click the numbers for the beta coefficients in the graphic below</p>

 &lt;p&gt; Beta coefficients below 1.0  indicate that the stock or portfolio is less risky than the market as a whole.  Thus, the risk premium is less than that of the market. When the market rises,  the stock (portfolio) will not be expected to rise as much; when the market  declines, the stock (portfolio) will be expected to decline to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; If the risk premium (the rate above the  risk-free rate) for the market is 8%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would have a  risk premium of 0.5 x 8% = 4%.&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;A stock or portfolio with a  beta coefficient of 1.0 has the same coefficient as the market as a whole, thus  it is expected to behave perfectly in sync with the market. If the market is up  8%, then the stock or portfolio is up 8% Thus, the risk premium of the stock or  portfolio is equal to that of the market.&lt;/p&gt;" >
                  <area shape="rect" coords="490,83,526,106" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Beta coefficients above 1.0  indicate that the stock or portfolio is more risky than the market as a whole.  Thus, its risk premium is greater than that of the market. When the market  rises, the stock (portfolio) will be expected to rise even more; when the  market declines, the stock (portfolio) will be expected to decline even  further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; If the risk premium (the rate above the  risk-free rate) for the market is 8%, a stock with a beta of 1.5 would have a  risk premium of 1.5 x 8% = 12%.&lt;/p&gt;" >

              <p>Another way to present beta is with a graphic chart that shows market return on one axis and the portfolio return on the other. The slope of the line is the portfolio’s beta. For example, the following chart shows a portfolio with a beta of 1.0. Since there is a one-to-one ratio of performance in the market to performance in the portfolio, then slope perfectly bisects the quadrant at a 45-degree angle. Thus, a return of 8% in the market will be mirrored by an equal portfolio return of 8%:</p>

              <p>If, however, the beta of the stock or portfolio veers from 1.0, then the slope of the line in the graph will change accordingly. For example, if the stock or portfolio has a beta of 0.5, then there is a 1-to-2 ratio of performance (see ratio of the green lines, showing the degree of the slope), and the slope of the line drops to half of what it was previously. Now, an 8% return in the market is reflected as a 4% return in the portfolio:</p>

            <div class="p7ap3-col-wrapper no-columns">
              <p>Alpha (a) identifies the difference in <em>expected return</em> of a portfolio, which  was based on the beta of the portfolio, versus the <em>actual returns</em> that were achieved. The higher your alpha, the  better your portfolio has done in achieving "excess returns." It is generally  considered to be a measure of the "value added" by the portfolio manager. The  higher the alpha, the higher the "value added" by the portfolio manager, while  a negative alpha indicates that the portfolio manager's efforts were  counterproductive, resulting in diminished returns. </p>
              <p>For example, in the following chart we have again depicted  our previous graph for a beta of 0.5. With a market return of 8%, we would have  expected a return of 4%. But in this case, we got a return of 7% because our  red line, which depicts the slope of beta, shifted up by 3%. This 3% is our  alpha and is typically considered the excess return over the expected return  that was provided by the portfolio manager.</p>

              <p>Thus alpha depicts “excess returns.” Generally speaking, portfolio managers are constantly seeking to generate alpha.</p>
