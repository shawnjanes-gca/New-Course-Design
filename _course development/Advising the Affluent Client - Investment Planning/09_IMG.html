    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Almost every investor will have some understanding of <strong><em>market risk</em></strong> and will likely define it as the "chance that I will lose money."  For purposes of this course, we will refer to "<strong><em>volatility" risk</em></strong>.  While inflation can deflate the value of the dollar substantially, the fluctuating rates of return that constitute market risk will also affect investment returns.</p>
  <p>As shown in the chart below, market risk can be observed by considering the fluctuating annual rates of return for stocks, bonds, and money market securities that occurred during the past 25 years. The chart shows the maximum and minimum returns that were realized in any single calendar year, as well as the average annual return for the entire 25 years.  Clearly, the potential risk associated with any given year is substantial; but the market risk is not the same for all asset classes, as some asset classes experience greater volatility than do others. </p>

&lt;p&gt;The maximum one-year return produced by stocks, as measured by S&amp;P 500 during the 25-year period, was 37.5%, occurring in 1995. The worst one-year rate of return for the same period was in 2008 when stocks lost 38.5% of their value. The annualized rate of return for the same period was 8.9%.&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;Bonds*, for the same 25-year period of time, had a maximum one-year total rate of return of 30.9%, occurring in 1995.  The worst one-year total rate of return for bonds was –8.7%, occurring in 1999.  The annualized rate of return for the 25-year period of time for bonds was 7.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money market instruments, as measured by 91-day T-Bills, produced a maximum rate of return for any one-year period during this 25-year period of 5.4%. This occurred in 1991. The minimum rate of return was 0.1%, occurring several times, but most recently in 2015. The annualized rate of return was 3.0%.&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;Inflation over the same period had a range from 0.1% in 2008 to a maximum of 3.3% in 1996 with an annualized inflation rate of 2.2% for this 25-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
