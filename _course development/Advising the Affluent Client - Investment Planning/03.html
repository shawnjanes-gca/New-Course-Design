<p>One of the most common problems you will encounter when examining an individual's portfolio is a lack of clearly defined investment objectives. In fact, most individuals will spend more time this year planning for their next vacation than they will spend developing a plan for how their portfolio will be managed. Intuitively, individuals know they should develop such a plan and review it regularly, but most fail to act. Most often, they simply have a general idea of why they are investing (such as for retirement or their children's education) but fail to map out a clear plan that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quantified return objectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific time horizon for achieving each key objective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear risk tolerance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well-defined guidelines for portfolio asset allocation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parameters for rebalancing the portfolio</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, studies indicate that over 75% of all high net worth investors have either an outdated investment plan or, worse, no written plan at all. Most often you encounter individuals with 2 to 4 investment "relationships", none of which are coordinated with the others, resulting in a disjointed portfolio with no clear objectives or purpose. The result is the equivalent of a ship without a rudder to steer it or a chart to map its course.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of having a well-defined plan and clear investment objectives, the pages that follow provide a framework for establishing an effective investment plan for clients.</p>
