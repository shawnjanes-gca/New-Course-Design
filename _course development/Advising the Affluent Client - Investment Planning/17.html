  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Why People Have Inappropriately-Structured Portfolios</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>While the need for appropriate portfolio structure is a basic concept, it is worth exploring why individuals consistently make mistakes in structuring their portfolio, maintaining an asset allocation that is either too conservative or too aggressive.  Here are two of the most common reasons for this phenomenon.</p>

              <p>One of the most powerful factors that often undermines effective investment decisions is emotion. To understand the impact of emotions on investment decision-making, a group of researchers at the University of Chicago conducted a very interesting study to test what has become known as <em><strong>Prospect Theory</strong></em>. Prospect Theory suggests that people respond differently to equivalent situations, depending on whether it is presented in the context of a loss or a gain. Put more simply, individuals are much more distressed at the prospect of losing $1.00 than they are excited by the prospect of gaining $1.00.</p>
              <div class="example-box"><h3>Case Study</h3>
              <p>Researchers asked two groups of individuals a question.</p>
              <p>The first group was asked the following question:</p>
              <p>In addition to what you own, you have been given $1,000.  You now have to choose one of the following options:</p>
              <ol type="A">
              	<li><span>A sure gain of $500</span></li>
                <li><span>A 50% chance of gaining $1,000 and a 50% chance of losing $500.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>The second group was asked this question:</p>
              <p>In addition to what you own, you have been given $1,000.  You now must choose one of the following options</p>
              <ol>
              	<li><span>A sure loss of $500</span></li>
                <li><span>A 50% chance of losing $1,000 and a 50% chance of losing nothing</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>How do you think each group responded? Click <a href="#" title="&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group was given the option of a sure gain with no risk, or the option of a potentially higher return by taking on extra risk.  A total of 84% were not willing to take on the extra risk to get the higher gain and selected option A, &quot;A sure gain of $500.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group was given the option of a sure loss with no risk, or the option of potentially avoiding the loss by taking on additional risk.  Because their aversion to the sure loss was so great, 69% selected choice B and were willing to take on greater risk in the hopes of avoiding a loss (even though they might lose twice as much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, people are more motivated to avoid losses than they are to seek gains.  That is why investors are generally assumed to be &quot;risk-averse.&quot;  However, this high propensity to risk aversion can lead to irrational choices.  Many individuals will construct portfolios that are far too conservative relative to their defined goals.  Their fear of short-term losses will cause them to overlook the long-term risk of failing to reach their investment objectives. Their fear of short-term losses will also cause them to “sell on emotions” when there is a market downturn, even when long-term prospects are good.&lt;/p&gt;

              <p>A second issue that often drives an inappropriately structured portfolio is failing to rebalance the portfolio to ensure the portfolio remains in line with their investment objectives.  Most often, individuals adopt a “buy and hold” strategy, feeling that it is the most conservative approach to investing.  However, a real life example illustrates the potential impact of this “strategy” on a portfolio</p>

                <p>As this situation clearly illustrates, failing to proactively manage the portfolio will lead to a portfolio structure that no longer falls within the established guidelines.  Worse still, simple math dictates that those asset classes with the best performance will, over time, make up the greatest percentage of the portfolio.  This means that failing to manage the portfolio structure will invariably result in an aggressively structured portfolio concentrated in the asset classes with the best recent performance, which are often poised to revert to the mean and pull performance down in the future.</p>
