<p>The third type of risk, <strong><em>Outcome Risk</em></strong>, is the risk that is most often overlooked by investors; but it is probably the most important risk for investors to consider.</p>
<p>Outcome risk is the risk that the final outcome of the investment plan will fail to meet an obligation or to achieve a desired result over a specified time. If the expected return of a portfolio is below the desired outcome, then the shortfall is a measure of the outcome risk. For example, if the expected return of an investment for a child's education fails to provide enough money when it is needed, then the portfolio has significant outcome risk.</p>
Investors normally tend to focus on the short-term volatility of market risk and often overlook outcome risk. However, outcome risk must always be kept in mind because it is the driver for taking risk in the first place.&nbsp; Rationally speaking, individuals are risk-averse and, therefore, would choose not to take on market risk unless that risk was less desirable than the risk of not reaching their goals.</blockquote>
