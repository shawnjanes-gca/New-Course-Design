<p>Another problem common to many investors is the lack of a disciplined process for buying and selling securities.&nbsp; The importance of a &ldquo;disciplined investment process&rdquo; is often touted in the marketplace, yet few investors fully understand what this concept really means.&nbsp; Simply put, a disciplined process of investing ensures that decisions are not made on the basis of emotions.&nbsp; This is important because, as evidenced previously, when investors make emotional decisions, the consequences are less than optimal.</p>

<p><strong>A True Story</strong></p>
<p>In late 1999, Jack Ross, seeking to capitalize on the Internet stock gold rush, decided to purchase a little known company that seemed poised to become a leader in the hottest new market on the Internet &ndash; the Business-to-Business auction market.&nbsp; This company, Ventro Corporation, (VNTR) had developed a niche in the chemicals industry as the premier B2B exchange site and its stock had soared from its IPO price in the low teens to $62.&nbsp; Days after Jack&rsquo;s purchase, VNTR soared to $85 and continued its torrid run, up over 15 points four days in a row until finally reaching a high of $240 in February 2000 - only months after Jack&rsquo;s purchase.&nbsp; Then, in early March, VNTR started to pull back, retreating 5 points, then 10 points, and then another 10.&nbsp; All the while, Jack thought, &ldquo;Hold on, it is just regrouping before making another big move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was right.&nbsp; VNTR did make a big move &ndash; only the move continued to be in the wrong direction.&nbsp; Finally the stock reached $62, the price where Jack had originally bought it.&nbsp; At this point, he considered buying more, rationalizing that it was a &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; at this price.&nbsp; He continued to hold on until he finally sold it when the stock hit $40 &ndash; a 35% loss.</p>
<p><img src="greene/advaffinvplan/issue4.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="335" /></p>
<p>How did Jack let this happen?&nbsp; How did Jack let a gain of nearly 400% turn into a 35% loss?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simple.&nbsp; He bought on emotion, simply trying to ride the Internet wave.&nbsp; Then, he sold on emotion, capitulating at the end and finally taking his loss.</p>
<p>This story is real and it is repeated by investors every day.&nbsp; The only method for avoiding this trap is to have a clear and disciplined approach to buying and selling securities.&nbsp; Simply asking well-phrased awareness questions will enable you to identify clients/prospects that have had similar experiences and open up the opportunity for you to position your solution of a more disciplined approach.</p>
