  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Quantifying Market Risk</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>In quantifying Market Risk, we begin to make a transition from the basics that nearly everyone understands to the more intricate aspects of asset allocation theory and its application in today's environment. The common way to measure market risk is through an examination of the dispersion of returns over a given time period. This can be measured in <strong><em>standard deviations </em><em>(</em></strong><strong><em>σ)</em></strong>,which is a statistical measure for quantifying the dispersion of returns around the <strong><em>mean (</em></strong><strong><em>μ)</em></strong> (also referred to as the "average"). The greater the standard deviation, the more volatile the asset is and the greater its risk. </p>

<p>To understand standard deviation and its application in the measurement of market risk, look at the following chart. It represents what is referred to as a normal distribution of events around the mean (μ<strong>)</strong>. When a series of events follow a normal distribution, we can begin to predict the future events within a given probability.</p>
