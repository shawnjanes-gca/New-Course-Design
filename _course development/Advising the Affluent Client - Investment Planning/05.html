  <p>The second step of the process is defining what assets the client has to offset these future liabilities.  Once again, consistently asking simple questions are all an advisor needs to get this important information.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Current Assets</strong></li>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>What specific assets do       you have to meet these goals?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Portfolio Structure</strong></li>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>How are these assets       managed currently?</li>
      <li>What specific securities do       you own in each account?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Additions to the      Portfolio</strong></li>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>On average, how much will       you add your portfolio/s each year?</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>While these questions are enormously straightforward, the key to success lies in execution.  Most often, advisors ask these (or similar) questions yet fail to get the detailed level of information they need.  Consider the dialogue in the following example. </p>
  <div class="example-box">
		<h3>Example</h3><br/>
    <table id="tableAlignLeft">
      <caption>
        Dialogue
      </caption>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row" width="20%">Advisor:</th>
          <td>"What specific assets do you have to meet these goals?"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Client:</th>
          <td>"I have about $150,000 set aside currently."</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Advisor:</th>
          <td>"Great.  How are these assets managed currently?"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Client:</th>
          <td>"Over the years I have really managed my accounts myself."</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Advisor:</th>
          <td>"Well, you have done a commendable job, but with the assets you have amassed, I feel we can add a great deal of value in working with you to structure a more effective portfolio focused on your specific needs.  How much do you anticipate you will add to this portfolio each year?"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Client:</th>
          <td>"I don't know.  It will probably vary from year to year but I would guess about $25,000 a year."</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This common exchange may seem effective at first blush, but consider the following questions:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Are you absolutely sure      the client has no other assets other than the $150,000 he discussed?</li>
      <li>How many current      investment relationships does the client have?</li>
      <li>Who does the client rely upon      for investment advice?</li>
      <li>What specific securities does the client own? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<p>Most often, clients will not give you all of the information you are seeking to obtain from any one question.  Take care to ensure that you get the specific information and detail you need before moving on in the conversation. </p>
