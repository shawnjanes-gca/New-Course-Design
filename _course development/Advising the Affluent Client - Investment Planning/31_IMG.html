  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Performance Analytics:  Risk-Adjusted Returns Analysis</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The final level of analysis investors should conduct to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach is examining risk-adjusted returns. For the purposes of this course, we will only examine the most common measures of risk-adjusted returns, equipping you with an effective approach to communicating how the following measures of risk-adjusted return are derived.</p>

              <p>The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Bill Sharpe, the father of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is widely used today in portfolio analytics, is a measure that defines the degree to which an investor is rewarded for taking risk in a portfolio.  More specifically, the Sharpe Ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
              <p><img src="" alt="" width="468" height="48" /></p> <!--@SU NEED IMAGE-->
              <p>In other words, assuming that short-term Treasury Bills represent the “risk-free” rate, the numerator of the Sharpe Ratio asks the question: “How much return does this portfolio achieve above the return I can get without taking on risk?” </p>
              <p>Then, using the portfolio’s standard deviation as a measure of the risk in the portfolio, the ratio asks a second question: “What is the ratio of this extra return to the risk I took on with this portfolio?”</p>
              <p>Obviously, when comparing portfolios, the greater the ratio of extra return to the risk (standard deviation) being taken on to generate that extra return, the better the portfolio’s risk-adjusted return. </p>
              <p>This measure is extremely useful because it allows us to compare the returns of different portfolios on a risk-adjusted basis, allowing us to compare apples-to-apples when comparing their performance.</p>

              <p>The Treynor Ratio is identical to the Sharpe Ratio except that the Treynor Ratio uses the portfolio beta as the measure of the portfolio’s risk profile.  As with the Sharpe Ratio, the higher the Treynor Ratio for a given portfolio, the more an investor is rewarded for the risk they take in the portfolio.</p>
