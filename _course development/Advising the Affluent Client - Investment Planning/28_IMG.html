  <p>Measuring the performance of a portfolio is a seemingly simple process - just calculate the rate of growth or the decline in value of the portfolio over any given period of time. However, it is not the process of calculating returns that is the issue - it is how the results are interpreted.</p>
  <p>As an advisor, your ability to help your clients understand how to effectively assess the performance of their portfolio can be invaluable to helping them reach their goals.  There are three perspectives clients should employ when evaluating the performance of their portfolio:
  	<ul>
    	<li>Absolute Returns Analysis</li>
        <li>Relative Returns Analysis</li>
        <li>Risk-Adjusted Returns Analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The pages that follow provide greater detail in understanding the relevance of each of these three perspectives.</p>
