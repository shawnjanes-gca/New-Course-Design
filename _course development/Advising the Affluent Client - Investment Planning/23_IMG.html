<p>To see how different indices correlate with each other, look at the chart below.</p>

<p>It can be easily seen that some indices have a higher degree of correlation with each other than do others. This is an important phenomenon to understand when evaluating a portfolio. Assets with a high correlation tend to act in the same manner in response to external stimuli. A portfolio of highly-correlated securities does little to add diversification.</p>
<p>Effective diversification should lower portfolio volatility. In other words, the benefit of diversification is that when one asset underperforms, another can compensate. Therefore, to effectively lower volatility in a portfolio, the assets, or asset classes, must have a <strong><em>low</em></strong> degree of correlation. Knowledge of how different asset classes correlate to each other is, therefore, a valuable aid in structuring a portfolio.</p>
