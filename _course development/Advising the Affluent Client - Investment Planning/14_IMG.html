<p>As the previous page illustrated, no amount of modeling can totally eliminate outcome risk (the risk that the result will not be what was expected.) While a plan may appear perfectly solid when looking at historical averages, many things can go wrong in the real world that might cause the plan to fail. For example, investment returns might be lower than expected, or the timing of an investment may be wrong, or death may occur sooner (or later) than planned. To have confidence in a plan, it is important to test it against various possibilities to establish an acceptable level of confidence that unexpected events will not result in the failure of the plan.</p>
  <p>Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis makes this possible. Grounded in gaming theory, where expected outcomes are modeled multiple times to establish probabilities of a single occurrence, <em><strong>Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis is a powerful tool available in many portfolio optimization software packages. Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis allows you to perform risk/probability simulations over multiple scenarios to determine a "success rate" for a given plan. </strong></em><strong></strong></p>

  	<h3>Overview of How the Analysis Works</h3>
    <p>First, the software randomly generates numbers for uncertain variables, such as interest rates, investment volatility, and life expectancy. By running hundreds, sometimes thousands of scenarios using randomized data points for annual return that fit within the historical range of expectations, Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis allows you to test the estimated success of the current plan data under different scenarios. For example, let’s suppose you have a twenty-year investment time horizon. Instead of just using average historical returns from the last 20 years to test if the outcome would meet expectations, it would use a multitude of different 20-year time horizons to test expectations.</p>
    <p>This allows you to answer such questions as: “What is the potential likelihood that I will outlive my portfolio?” or “Can I count on having enough money to fund my education needs?” </p>
    <p>This testing will provide you with a more realistic perspective on the viability of a plan achieving the desired goals in a dynamic environment where market returns cannot be predicted, either year-to-year or over intermediate periods of time.</p>
