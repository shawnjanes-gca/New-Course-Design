  <p>Adjusting return for the impact of inflation is known as deriving the <strong>real rate of return</strong>. This is calculated as follows:<strong></strong></p>
  <p><em class="explanation-widget-box">REAL RETURN = TOTAL RETURN - INFLATION</em></p>
  <p><div class="imageRight"><img src="greene/aac_investment_planning/images/Inflation_Rick_Real_Rates_Return.png" width="488" height="278" alt=""/></div>
  In other words, real return takes into account the deflated growth of an investment. </p>
  <p> The graphic on this page shows in red the annualized <strong>&quot;nominal&quot;</strong> (before adjustment for inflation) rate of return for stocks, bonds, money market securities, and inflation for the last 25 years. It shows that stocks grew at a nominal compound rate of 8.9%, bonds grew at a rate of 7.3%, and money market securities at 3.0%. But the <strong>&quot;real&quot;</strong> picture, after adjusting for inflation, is quite different.</p>
  
  <p> When the eroding effect of inflation is taken into account, the real return for each asset class (shown in gray) was reduced to 6.7%, 5.0%, and 0.5% respectively. These may not reduce exactly by the 2.2% inflation rate due to the effect of compounding.</p>
