  <p>The second issue is the need to structure the investment portfolio in a manner that is consistent with the client’s objectives, time horizon, and tolerance for risk.  For example, how often do you encounter a situation similar to the one below?</p>
  
  
  <div class="example-box"> <h3>Mr. Brown</h3>
  <p>John Brown, age 42, has a portfolio currently valued at just over $150,000.  John has stated that he is setting aside this money for his future retirement some 20+ years from now, at which time he feels he will need the portfolio to be worth about $750,000.  He feels he can add little to this portfolio over the next 20 years; therefore, this portfolio must generate significant growth to reach his objectives.  Currently, John’s portfolio has the following allocation:</p>
  <p> 
  	<table id="tableAlignLeft">
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Large Cap Equities</th>
          <td>25%</td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
          <th scope="row">Short-Term Fixed Income</th>
          <td>60%</td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
          <th scope="row">Cash Equivalents</th>
          <td>15%</td>
        </tr>
   </table>
  </p>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
 
  <p>Although John’s objectives are very clear, his portfolio is not properly structured relative to his objectives because it is far too conservatively invested to reach his stated objectives. Perhaps out of an abundance of caution in seeking to keep market risk low, this portfolio significantly increases John’s exposure to outcome risk.</p>
  <p>In contrast, you may also encounter individuals who take far too much risk in their portfolios given their objectives.  In either case, inappropriate asset allocation can have horrible consequences. </p>
