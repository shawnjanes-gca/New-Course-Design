<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>*Frank Reilly and Keith Brown report one set of studies for randomly selected stocks that approximately 90% of the benefit of diversification is derived by portfolios that have from 12 to 18 stocks&rdquo; in their book "Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management" (see http://news.morningstar.com/classroom2/course.asp?docId=145385&amp;page=4&amp;CN=)</em></span></p>

<p>The third issue that must be addressed is having appropriate diversification. Though portfolio diversification is critical and most investors know that their portfolios should be diversified, most have no real concept of what constitutes appropriate diversification.&nbsp; The result is a portfolio that is often either <strong>under-diversified </strong>or <strong>over-diversified.</strong></p>
<h3>Under-Diversified Portfolio</h3>
<p>Under-diversified portfolios are those that have high concentrations in relatively few individual stocks, sectors of the market, investment styles, and/or asset classes.&nbsp; The result is a portfolio with a risk profile that is much higher than warranted.&nbsp; Under-diversified portfolios are often the result of individuals being attracted to &ldquo;hot sectors of the market.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is also common to see large concentrations in one individual stock.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Over-Diversified Portfolio</h3>
<p>When considering portfolio diversification, many investors fail to realize that you can have too much of a good thing.&nbsp; In investing, there comes a point at which owning more securities in a portfolio results in higher cost of ownership (fees), which serves only to dilute the potential return of the portfolio.&nbsp; Such is often the case with investors who own multiple mutual funds, each with a similar investment objective.</p>
Maintaining a portfolio that is appropriately diversified requires a sound, systematic discipline and proactive ongoing oversight.&nbsp; Investors who fail to carefully manage their portfolio to ensure it is appropriately diversified have a definitive need for help.</blockquote>
