  <p>There are essentially three steps to establishing a clear investment plan. The first step is to understand the client's objectives and the timespan for achieving those objectives. Whether it is providing for college education expenses for their children, saving for a vacation home, or saving for their retirement, the foundation of a good investment plan and asset al location strategy is specific quantification of the required dollars needed to meet the client's specific objectives and a time horizon for when the assets need to be available.  Without this specific information, neither you nor the client can establish a truly rational investment plan.  </p>
  <p> Your role in helping quantify the investment objective is to determine the specific amount required to fund the client's objectives and to identify the number of years available to reach them.  Following are two simple questions you should consistently ask your clients to begin this dialogue.  </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Objective/s - </strong>What are your <strong>specific</strong> goals for these assets (retirement savings, college education,      etc.)?</li>
    <li><strong>Time Horizon - </strong>When will you need to spend the money to meet      these obligations?</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
    <h3>Important Note</h3>
		<p>These two basic questions are intuitive to many advisors and, therefore, tend to be posed to clients in a manner not too dissimilar from a doctor going through a litany of questions at the beginning of your annual check-up –"Have you experienced any headaches? Shortness of breath? Dizziness?</p>
		<p>Take care not to be clinical in the way you ask these basic but enormously important questions.  And more importantly, listen to your client respond to these questions.  Make sure you have a true understanding of both the financial goals and the emotions associated with them.</p>
		<p>By working with the client to understand the specific liabilities the portfolio is designed to address, you as the advisor can begin the process of structuring a portfolio with the highest probability of achieving these objectives. </p>
  </div>
<p>Contrast this approach with one used by many advisors in the marketplace, which begins by seeking to understand the individual's "risk tolerance."  While understanding the client's risk tolerance is critically important, starting the conversation with "how much of this money are you comfortable losing" is not a very compelling dialogue.  By first understanding the objectives of the money, you will gain insights that will help you structure the portfolio while also learning more about what is really important to your client, both financially and emotionally.  </p>
