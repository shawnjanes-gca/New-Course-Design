<h2>Periodic Review and Measuring Success</h2>

<p>Now that we have discussed the five key issues for investment success, it is important to point out that investing is <strong><em>an active process</em></strong>. It requires regular review to maintain alignment with the investment plan. Even the plan itself may need to be changed from time to time to allow for changing life circumstances or market conditions.</p>
<p>A common problem many investors face in performing regular reviews is the inability to access clear and accurate performance information on their portfolios. Many investors, when stuck for an answer, will tell you how great their performance has been, citing their purchase of the latest hot stock or an impeccably timed sale just before a security&rsquo;s decline.&nbsp; However, very few can do more than speak in generalities about their performance, while fewer still actually review performance on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The reason that investors have historically failed to track and analyze the performance of their portfolios has been the lack of tools available to help them measure performance.&nbsp; Tracking the results of individual securities or a few mutual funds is not extremely difficult; however, investors with multiple holdings in multiple accounts spread across four or five different firms face a daunting task.</p>
<p>For those who do track performance, very few are effective in their analysis. For example, consider how clients typically respond when asked about their performance. When the markets are good, they will often make <strong><em>relative performance</em></strong> comparisons: &ldquo;Why was my fund up only 40% this year when the market was up 42%?&rdquo; However, the same client will shift to <strong><em>absolute performance</em></strong> comparisons when the markets are bad - &ldquo;Why is my portfolio down 8% this year&rdquo; - with no regard for the fact that the market was down 15%.&nbsp; The following pages provide some insight into how to translate this mindset into potential advisory opportunities with your clients.</p>
