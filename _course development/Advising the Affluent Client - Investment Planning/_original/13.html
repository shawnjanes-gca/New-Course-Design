<p>It is often difficult to motivate clients to plan; it can be even more difficult to motivate them to take action &ldquo;today&rdquo; regarding goals that may be many years in the future. While the goals are perceived as important, it is just too easy for them to allow the &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; of today&rsquo;s needs overtake the &ldquo;importance

<p>An understanding of the impact of time upon outcome risk can be a powerful motivator in helping a client understand the importance of developing and following through on an investment plan. This impact is threefold:</p>

<p><strong><em>Compounding</em></strong> is the ability to get return on top of return. As with the classic example, if you begin with a penny and double your money each day, within a month you are a multi-millionaire.</p>
<p>Because of the power of compounding, investing &ldquo;sooner&rdquo; is generally more beneficial than investing &ldquo;later.&rdquo; The sooner you begin saving and investing for a specific outcome, the greater the likelihood that you will achieve that outcome.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>For traditional asset allocation models to give correct results, all the inputs that go into determining the allocation must be correct. This means that values used for each asset or asset class, such as <em>expected return</em>, <em><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s">correlation</a></strong>,</em> and <em>standard deviation,</em> are correct. If any one input is invalid, then the entire allocation model falls apart.</p>
<p>Here is a recent example:</p>
<table style="width: 95%;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div id="example03">
<p>Suppose you were developing an investment plan in December 1999 designed to meet the long-term retirement needs for a client. When projecting the future returns required to develop a traditional asset allocation model, you would logically use the historical results of the previous few years. Looking just at the S&amp;P 500, you would be using historical results of 28.34% in 1998, 33.1% in 1997, and 22.68% in 1996. &nbsp;Using these return patterns as your historical precedent would have resulted in overstated expected returns and understated volatility for the stock portion of the projected portfolio because actual returns that followed those years were -9.03% in 2000, -11.85% in 2001, and -21.97% in 2002. Such skewing of the data would lead to improper planning and asset allocation, evidence of the fact that simplistic, traditional asset allocation modeling alone will not provide an effective answer for clients.</p>

<p>This example highlights the fact that your expected return, or any other input you might choose in your modeling that is based on past history, is the average result of the historical time span you use. Depending upon when you start and end that time span, and the duration of the time span you use, the average result you derive will vary. This highlights the importance of avoiding the use of very short time spans in determining historical precedents; the outcome you derive from such inputs can be dramatically different from the reality you will achieve.</p>
<p>Clients also need to be aware that future results may be quite dissimilar to past performance, especially in the short term. The good news is that when longer time spans are used for deriving inputs in the asset allocation modeling, while also starting early in investing so that there are longer time spans before the investment returns will be needed, then the future will more closely resemble the past. Once again, starting early is the best way to minimize one&rsquo;s outcome risk.</p>

<p>One problem with modeling with historical averages is that life doesn&rsquo;t always present you with the &ldquo;average.&rdquo; This can be especially significant in the short run. When it comes to investments, sometimes &ldquo;timing is everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Investor #1 had the misfortune of beginning in 2008, a year in which the S&amp;P significantly underperformed its preceding 30-year average return. Thus, instead of achieving his expected outcome of $191,110, he fell short of his target by $62,450, or 32.7%</p>
<p>In contrast, Investor #2 not only had the good fortune of missing the poor performance of 2008 by placing his investment at the start of 2009, he also had the good fortune of ending his 5-year investment in 2013 when the S&amp;P 500 significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500. Thus, Investor #2 exceeded his expected outcome by $51,900, or 28.9%. Both investors made the same investment for the same time period; the difference was purely due to timing.</p>

<p>The last two examples illustrate that modeling solely on the basis of averages provides an incomplete solution. Yet that is exactly what many traditional asset allocation models do.&nbsp; <br /> Clearly, more sophisticated investment planning requires a more dynamic approach than can be achieved in such static models. What is needed is an approach that will test the investment plan against different scenarios. Using our last scenario of the two investors with 5 years until retirement, what is needed is an approach that would test the investment plan against the possibility that they might be fortunate enough to have stellar investment in the first year, but they might also be unfortunate in experiencing a downward market turn in their first year. Given all the possible scenarios, what is the likelihood that their plan will succeed?</p>
<p>Such an approach is provided by a <strong><em>Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis</em></strong>. Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis enables advisors to run literally thousands of scenarios to define the probability of any particular strategy falling short of the desired result based on the anomalies outlined above.</p>
