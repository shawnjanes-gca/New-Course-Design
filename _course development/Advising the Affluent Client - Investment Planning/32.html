<p>This concludes this course in the Advising the Affluent Series. Most investors buy and sell securities on emotions.&nbsp; They tend to follow the pack, buying after most of the opportunity for gain is gone and selling after most of the decline has occurred.&nbsp; Such behavior is a recipe for poor performance, if not disaster.</p>
<p>You can offer a better approach.&nbsp; Using the knowledge you have gained from this course, you can offer a rational methodology that places emphasis on:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Portfolios that are built around client needs, risk tolerances, and time horizons</li>
<li>Proper allocation instead of picking hot stocks</li>
<li>Diversification of risk</li>
<li>Discipline in making buy/sell decisions</li>
<li>Appropriate consideration of tax-efficient strategies</li>
</ul>
<p>And on an ongoing basis, you can provide monitoring and measurement of performance.</p>
<p>The end result for the client is peace of mind &ndash; greater confidence in the expected results and lower anxiety throughout the process.</p>
<p>Apply yourself to not only master the techniques of proper asset allocation, but to also master your ability to communicate the techniques and their advantages to clients.&nbsp; By helping them to become more knowledgeable themselves, they will have higher confidence in the role you play and place greater value in the services you provide.</p>
<p>Commit yourself to applying the principles in this course and you will see both an increase in your production and client satisfaction with the value you add.</p>
