  <p>This concludes this course in the Advising the Affluent Series. Most investors buy and sell securities on emotions.  They tend to follow the pack, buying after most of the opportunity for gain is gone and selling after most of the decline has occurred.  Such behavior is a recipe for poor performance, if not disaster.</p>
  <p>You can offer a better approach.  Using the knowledge you have gained from this course, you can offer a rational methodology that places emphasis on:</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
  	<ul>
    	<li>Portfolios that are built around client needs, risk tolerances, and time horizons</li>
        <li>Proper allocation instead of picking hot stocks</li>
        <li>Diversification of risk</li>
        <li>Discipline in making buy/sell decisions</li>
        <li>Appropriate consideration of tax-efficient strategies</li>
	</ul>
  </div>
<p>And on an ongoing basis, you can  provide monitoring and measurement of performance.</p>
  <p>The  end result for the client is peace of mind – greater confidence in the expected  results and lower anxiety throughout the process.</p>
  <p>Apply yourself to not only master the techniques of proper  asset allocation, but to also master your ability to communicate the techniques  and their advantages to clients.  By  helping them to become more knowledgeable themselves, they will have higher  confidence in the role you play and place greater value in the services you  provide. </p>
 <p>Commit yourself to applying the principles in this course  and you will see both an increase in your production and client satisfaction  with the value you add.</p>
