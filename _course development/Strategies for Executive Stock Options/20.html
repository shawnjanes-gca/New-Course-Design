<p>Most companies make arrangements with a brokerage company for employees to exercise their options without requiring a cash payment. In these cases, the purchase and sale of the company stock are executed on the same day. On the settlement date, the optionee (owner of the option) receives the excess of the proceeds from the sale of the stock over the exercise price without needing any money to execute the transaction. To the extent that the optionee sells some or all of the stock immediately upon exercising the option, the optionee will have taxable compensation income in the amount of the net sales proceeds because the holding period requirement has not been met.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Here, a loan is obtained to provide liquidity for purchasing the stock. If the stock has appreciated significantly, the loan can often be accomplished by purchasing the stock on margin, with the equity in the stock (excess of fair market value over the exercise price) sufficient to cover the equity requirements of the margin account. If the stock pays dividends, the dividend income will help offset the cost of the loan. As a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, however, companies no longer can be the lender where the employee also is an executive officer (or director) of the company.</p>

<p>If the employer's plan permits it, this strategy makes use of IRC Section 1036, which states that "No gain or loss shall be recognized if common stock in a corporation is exchanged solely for common stock in the same corporation." This is an attractive alternative for anyone who currently owns the company stock. In this scenario, the shares owned outright are swapped with the company for those available through the option, without triggering a capital gain tax on the unrealized appreciation on the stocks already owned. [<em>Note: If the shares being tendered were previously acquired via an ISO exercise, then those shares must be "mature" (held for at least one year from the date of exercise and two years from the date of grant ) to defer gain recognition on tendered shares.]</em></p>
<p>Once swapped, a number of the optioned shares equal to the number exchanged are assigned the basis and holding period of the previously owned shares. The remaining exercised shares are given a basis of $0 and start a new holding period for capital gains purposes.</p>

<p>Once exercised, by holding the stock for a year and a day after exercise, it is possible to convert all appreciation into capital gains. The shares with a basis of $0 are called the "additional shares" and have a basis and holding period of 0.</p>

<p><strong>Meet Mr. Carol</strong></p>
<p>Suppose Mr. Carol has an option to purchase 1000 shares @ $10 per share. Thus, he needs $10,000 to purchase the shares. The current market price is $20 per share.</p>
<p>Suppose he already owns 500 shares outright, which he has held for three years, with a basis of $5 per share. He could sell the 500 shares for $10,000, but would have to pay a long-term capital gain tax on the $7,500 gain. Not only does this trigger a tax, but will leave him short of the required $10,000 he needs to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Instead, he swaps his 500 shares, worth $10,000, for the 1,000 optioned shares. This is known as a tax-deferred exchange, because no taxes are triggered by the exchange.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Code states that if property is acquired in such an exchange, the basis of the property will be the same as that of the property exchanged. Since the basis in his previously owned shares were $2,500 (500 x $5), the basis of the 1,000 exercised shares will also be $2,500. This basis will be allocated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>500 shares with a basis of $5 per share</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>500 shares with a basis of $0</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the 1,000 shares are broken out so as to replicate the 500 shares, or the "swapped shares," he originally owned. Those 500 shares with the $5 per share basis will also inherit his original holding period of 3 years, meaning they can be sold at any time, with appreciation treated as a long-term capital gain. The remaining 500 shares will be treated as a new acquisition, and their holding period for long-term gains will begin after their acquisition.</p>
