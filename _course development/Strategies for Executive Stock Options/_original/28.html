<p>Another form of equity-based compensation similar to Restricted Stock Awards is the granting of Restricted Stock Units. While almost the same form of compensation as Restricted Stock, the difference is the grant is not actual stock, but rather, a "unit" that represents a certain amount of company stock. Upon vesting, the employee receives either stock or cash as defined by the plan. In some plans, the employee can choose stock or cash.</p>
<p>The value of RSUs is tied directly to the price of the company's stock. In the case of a dividend-paying stock, the RSU has no dividend rights. However, if the company decides it would like to pay a dividend on RSUs, the company has the ability to issue <strong><em>Dividend Equivalent Units (DEU),</em></strong> which allows the company to distribute additional RSUs equal to the amount of the dividend paid.</p>
<p>Unlike stock options, there is no exercise with RSUs. Upon vesting, the individual simply receives shares or cash and will have a taxable event at that time. The tax due will be calculated on the FMV at vesting and is taxed as ordinary income. The vesting schedule for RSUs may either be time-based (i.e., at the end of a specific period of time) or performance-based (e.g., based upon achievement of corporate goals). Once vested, the person generally receives shares of the company or the cash equivalent (depending upon the rules of the plan), although some plans may allow or require deferment until a later date.</p>
