<p>Option holders are often subject to the risk associated with large concentrations of company stock. While this risk exists prior to execution of the option, particularly if the stock has appreciated considerably in value, it is more acute if the options have been exercised and the stock is being held.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, hedging strategies are a means of providing such protection. However, when dealing with compensatory options, a host of issues must be considered. Among these considerations are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many companies ban employees from utilizing hedging strategies on company stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the owner is a company insider, then the short swing rules come into play, which could impact future flexibility in trading the securities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedging strategies can prevent dividends from being taxed as "qualified dividends."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedging strategies may introduce additional complex tax issues, such as constructive sale rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when a client seeks to hedge the risk associated with a concentrated position, recognize that this is a complex enterprise that is well beyond the scope of this course. Pursuing such a strategy should not be done without the involvement of the client's tax advisor and other professionals with specific expertise in this area.</p>
