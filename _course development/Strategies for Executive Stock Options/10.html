<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Generally, grants must expire (or convert to NQSOs) within three months of termination of employment, within one year of death or disability, or within 10 years of the grant date, whichever occurs first. Note that the company stock option plan can dictate shorter terms than above but cannot allow longer terms.</p>
<p>Important note regarding "affiliates": In the case of employees who have more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock in the company ("affiliates" of the company), the timeframe for option expiration is reduced to a maximum of five years and the option price must be at least 110% of the FMV at grant.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Options must be granted at the stock's current fair market value or higher. There can be no intrinsic value in the award at the time of grant. In addition to complying with the other requirements for ISOs, this prevents the grant from being considered a taxable event.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Only $100,000 worth of ISOs, based on the FMV at grant, can become exercisable in any calendar year. <strong><em>Note that how many options are actually exercised will not affect this rule. This is solely based on when they become exercisable, which is determined by the plan or the grant document.</em></strong> This rule uses a FIFO accounting method in determining which shares qualify, meaning if the $100,000 limit is exceeded, then the most recently granted options will be disqualified first. In most cases, the record keeper will calculate this, but it is important to keep in mind that an acceleration of vesting can result in the disqualification of much of the ISO.</p>
<p>For example, if there is a change of control in the company (acquisition), the vesting schedule typically accelerates. In that case, 100% of the unvested options will vest on the date a change of control takes place. In such an event, the likelihood of exceeding the $100,000 limit increases significantly, and the most recently granted options are likely to become disqualified.</p>
