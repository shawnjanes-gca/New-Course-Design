<p>For tax purposes, stock options are classified into two types: <strong><em>Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)</em></strong> and <strong><em>Nonqualified Stock Options (NQSOs)</em></strong>. Let's look briefly at the general definitions of each, followed by a more detailed analysis of the mechanics for both.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Nonqualified Stock Options are the most common compensatory option granted for purposes of equity compensation. While these options provide the employee the ability to participate in future upward price movements in the company's stock price, they do not have specifically preferential tax treatment like Incentive Stock Options do. Essentially, any option agreements that do not comply with the Internal Revenue Code for Incentive Stock Options fall into this classification. As such, they are not restricted to employees and may be used for directors and outside providers.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Incentive Stock Options can only be granted to employees and must comply with specific guidelines established by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 422, which gives them preferential tax treatment. There are no tax consequences upon the grant. Additionally, provided the underlying shares are held after the exercise of the option, the option holder does not incur any regular income tax at exercise - but the employee may be subject to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in the year the option is exercised. Provided the shares are sold at least one year after the exercise date and two years from the date of grant, the difference between the strike price and the FMV at sale is taxed as a capital gain.</p>
