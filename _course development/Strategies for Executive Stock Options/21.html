<h2>Exercise Considerations of Nonqualified Stock Options</h2>
</blockquote>
</td>

<blockquote>
<p>There are differences in opinion regarding the best strategy for the exercise of nonqualified stock options. Many people say to exercise early and hold the stock. This way the spread that is taxed as ordinary compensation income upon exercise is typically small, and the appreciation over time will be subject to the lower capital gains rates. But others criticize this approach, pointing out that the underlying stock can decline in value after the exercise and this eliminates the leverage in the option.</p>

<div id="p7GPc1_2" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Does the optionee have the liquidity required to pay the option price for the stock, as well as the taxes upon exercise of the option? If not, the only alternative may be a cashless exercise through the broker dealer. With a cashless exercise, the brokerage firm loans the money to make the purchase and then immediately sells part of the stock after exercise to lower the loan. If after the cashless exercise the optionee holds the unsold shares, the optionee's leverage in the position is significantly reduced as a significant number of the shares were sold to pay the strike price and the withholding taxes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_3" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Does the optionee believe that the stock will continue to appreciate over the next 12 months? If the answer is yes, then there appears to be a sufficient window of opportunity in which to position the spread to be taxed as a long-term capital gain. The risk that should be weighed against this is the possibility of a decline in the stock price and tying up capital in the shares.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_4" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>If the stock pays a dividend, the option holder will not receive it until the options are exercised and the underlying shares are held. If a significant portion of the stock's return is in the form of dividends, it may be beneficial to exercise and hold the shares rather than the options.</p>

<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>What percentage of the optionee's net worth is tied up in the underlying stock? If the percentage is high, then he or she may want to consider a strategy that helps diversify the risk of the concentration.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>If the optionee anticipates future appreciation in the stock, the optionee may desire to buy and hold the stock. Of course, this exercise, unlike that for ISOs, will generate a regular income tax and the optionee will need sufficient liquidity to pay that tax if no shares are to be sold. However, if the shares continue to appreciate, the realized gain at an ultimate sale would likely result in lower capital gains taxes (or a possible stepped up basis at death) versus a larger and larger portion taxed as compensation if exercised in the future. Also, if a stock swap is used to purchase the shares, the purchase can be accomplished with no cash outlay and converts all anticipated future appreciation into a capital gains transaction if/when sold as well as deferring the realization of the gain on the swapped shares (or a possible stepped up basis at death).</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Why Not Continue to Hold the Options?</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Continuing to hold onto an option once vested has both advantages and risks. The primary advantage is that the option holder has the benefit of a leveraged-type investment that requires no capital outlay. The primary disadvantage to consider is that if the underlying stock continues to appreciate, the option holder could potentially have a higher tax burden upon exercise than if exercised now and held for capital gains treatment on any future appreciation.</p>
