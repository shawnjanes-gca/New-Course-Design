<p><strong>83(b) Election Examples</strong></p>
<p>A Restricted Stock Award of 10,000 shares is issued when the stock is trading at $5. The individual makes an 83(b) election on 10,000 shares and pays $17,500 in taxes ($50,000 FMV x 35% tax rate). This also begins the clock for capital gains purposes. Two years later, when the stock vests, the stock is trading at $20. Had the individual not made the 83(b) election, $70,000 in taxes ($200,000 FMV x 35% tax rate) would have been due. Instead, the individual sells the shares at $20 and pays long-term capital gains of $22,500 ($150,000 taxable gain x 15% LTCG). In the scenario where the 83(b) election was made, the total taxes paid are $30,000 less than if the election had not been made.</p>

<p>An additional benefit of this election is the treatment of dividends. Without the election, any dividend income paid during the vesting period is taxed at ordinary income rates. If the election is made, preferential dividend rates may apply.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits, it is again important to keep in mind that there are risks associated with this election. As previously mentioned, the election cannot be reversed. If the stock price declines or the award is forfeited, the individual may end up paying more in taxes than would have been due otherwise. Additionally, if liquidity is an issue, deferral of all taxes until vesting means that the taxable event will take place at a time when shares can generally be sold to pay the taxes. If, however, the election is made prior to vesting, then the shares are not available for sale and the individual will have to finance the payment of the taxes through some other means.</p>
<p>Another important point is this election can only be made on actual shares. Hence, this strategy is irrelevant for Restricted Stock Units and for some types of Performance Shares.</p>
