<p>One of the ways in which companies tie their employee compensation to the performance of the company is by offering forms of equity-based compensation. Equity-based compensation can take several forms. A brief list of the types of compensation strategies are highlighted below and each will be detailed in greater depth at various stages of this course. The first section of the course is focused on option-based awards and covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Stock Options (ESOs)</strong> - This form of compensation is a compensatory option giving the holder the right to buy the company stock at a fixed price over a set period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Options</strong> - This is a form of stock options where the quantity or exercisability is tied to some type of performance criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)</strong> - This is a variation of a stock option. The employee receives a grant providing the ability to participate in the upward price movement of the company stock. Unlike an option, the SAR does not require the employee to pay for the stock at exercise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second portion of the course covers share-based awards in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Restricted Stock (RS)</strong> and <strong>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)</strong> - These are outright grants of equity shares or units that equate to shares that have certain time restrictions on their sale and transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Shares</strong> - This is similar to restricted stock except the requirement that must be met for them to become saleable or to determine the quantity received is based on a performance criteria rather than time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Properly structured, equity compensation can both attract and retain employees. It is also an effective compensation strategy commonly used by many organizations in lieu of cash compensation for board members, consultants, and others who are involved in various aspects of an organization's business.</p>
