<h2>Section 83(b) Election for Restricted Stock</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>When an employee receives a grant of Restricted Stock, there are restrictions on the ability to freely resell those securities. Therefore, no tax on this compensation is due at that time. This ability to defer recognition of income is typically beneficial; however, it can also be costly. If, for example, the stock rises in value from the time of the grant to the time the shares vest and are freely sellable, the client will pay ordinary income tax on the total amount of the stock at the time of vesting. The result is a higher tax bill than if the grant would have been taxed immediately, with appreciation subsequently taxed as a capital gain.</p>
<p>In situations like this, the client does have an alternative. The client can make what is known as an 83(b) election within 30 days of the time of the grant by informing the IRS of the intent to have the shares taxed at ordinary income rates at the grant date rather than at the vesting date of the Restricted Stock.</p>
<p>Of course, this election is not without risks. For example, it is possible that the stock will decline in value while the restrictions are in place. Furthermore, if after making the election the property is actually forfeited (e.g., because the employee separates from service), the statute does not allow any deduction for the amount that was included in income as a result of the 83(b) election, although it is still possible to recognize a capital loss. For these reasons, the 83(b) election is usually made when there is a strong expectation for appreciation of the stock (i.e., IPO) or the value of the stock is very low at grant, therefore resulting in a smaller tax bill.</p>
