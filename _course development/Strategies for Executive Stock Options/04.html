<p>A compensatory stock option provides the <strong><em>right</em></strong>, but not the obligation, to <strong><em>purchase</em></strong> company stock at a <strong><em>specific price</em></strong> over a <strong><em>specific period of time</em></strong>. Because of the <strong><em>limited life</em></strong>, the option becomes worthless after the expiration date.</p>

<p>If, prior to the expiration of the option, the price of the stock is greater than the exercise price (also known as the strike price) of the option, the option holder can receive the difference between the market value of the stock and the strike price by exercising the stock option and selling the underlying shares. The difference between the market value and the strike is referred to as the <strong><em>spread</em></strong> or intrinsic value. If the stock price drops below the strike price of the option, there is no intrinsic value and it does not make sense to exercise the options since the shares can be purchased in the open market at a lower price. Stock options with a strike price lower than the market value of the stock are said to be "in-the-money." Those with a strike price higher than the market values of the stock are said to be "underwater."</p>

<p>Think of it in these simple terms. In the red-hot "dot.com" industry, many companies were in desperate need of talent, yet short of funding. Many employees were willing to accept compensation packages consisting primarily of compensatory options. As such, if the company went public and share prices soared, they owned the ability to buy the stock at a stated low price, profiting from the difference in that price and the market price. But this was not without risk because the share price in the marketplace could also fall below the options' exercise price, at which point the options would have no intrinsic value.</p>
