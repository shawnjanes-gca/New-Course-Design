  <h1><span class="pagetitle">What is a Compensatory Stock Option?</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A compensatory stock option is defined below: </p>
  <div class="example-box"><p>A compensatory stock option provides the <strong><em>right</em></strong>, but not the obligation,  to <strong><em>purchase</em></strong> company stock at a <strong><em>specific price (the "exercise price" or "strike price")</em></strong> over a <strong><em>specific  period of time</em></strong>. Because of the specified period of time, the option  becomes worthless if not exercised by the end of the specified period of time  (the <strong><em>expiration</em></strong> <strong><em>date</em></strong>).</p>
  </div>
  <p>Typically, the right to purchase the stock is not immediately available when the compensatory stock option is granted to the employee, but vests over time. This provides a powerful incentive for the employee to remain with the company and work to enhance the value of the company stock. </p>
  <p>If, prior to the expiration date of the option, the option's  exercise price (a.k.a. the "strike price") is lower than the market price of  the stock, then the option holder can receive the difference between the exercise  price and the market value of the stock by simply exercising the stock option  and then selling the underlying shares. This difference between the exercise  price and the market value of the stock is referred to as the <strong><em>spread</em></strong> or <strong><em>intrinsic  value</em></strong>. In this case, when the exercise price is lower than the market  value, the spread is positive and the option is said to be "<strong>i<em>n-the-money</em></strong>."</p>
  <p>If, however, the market price drops below the exercise price  of the option, there is no intrinsic value and it does not make sense to  exercise the options since the shares can be purchased in the open market at a  lower price. Those options with an exercise price higher than the market values  of the stock are said to be "<strong><em>underwater</em></strong>" because they have no  intrinsic value.</p>
  <div class="example-box"><p><strong>Example.com</strong></p>
<p>Think of it in these simple terms. In the red-hot "dot.com" industry, many companies were in desperate need of talent, yet short of funding. Many employees were willing to accept compensation packages consisting primarily of compensatory options. As such, if the company went public and share prices soared, they owned the ability to buy the stock at a stated low price, profiting from the difference in that price and the market price. But this was not without risk because the share price in the marketplace could also fall below the options' exercise price, at which point the options would have no intrinsic value.
