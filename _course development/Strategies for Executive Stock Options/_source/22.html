<h2>Stock Appreciation Rights</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>While very similar to stock options, Stock Appreciation Rights - also referred to as "SARs" - are another form of option-based compensation. Stock Appreciation Rights have been in existence for some time, but their use has historically been limited due to their accounting treatment, which required that, unlike ISOs and NQSOs, employers must expense the grants. However, when the FASB mandated that corporations must also begin expensing ISOs and NQSOs, SARs' popularity soared as they became equally attractive compensation strategies.</p>
<p>SARs are very similar in form to NQSOs in that they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Granted to employees at a set price</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually subject to a specific vesting schedule set forth under the terms of the company plan, which may be time or performance based</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a defined expiration date</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the SARs vest, the employee can exercise them and receive either cash for the amount that the SAR has appreciated above the strike price or, in some cases, for a stock equivalent to that same amount. Whether the SARs are stock or cash settled will be determined by the plan.</p>
<p>The advantage to the employee of SARs over NQSOs lies in the fact that the employee does not have to actually pay to exercise, making the exercise process far easier and less complex financially for the option holder. From a tax perspective, SARs are similar to NQSOs in that the difference between the exercise price and the FMV is taxed as compensation upon exercise.</p>

<p>SARs are granted to the employee. The grant can be either "Stand-alone SARs," which are exercisable only for cash, or "Tandem SARs," A Tandem SAR is granted in conjunction with a Nonqualified Stock Option or an Incentive Stock Option and provides the optionee with a choice. When exercising, the employee can choose to exercise and receive a stock option, or exercise as a SAR. The choice of one eliminates the right to exercise the other. A partial exercise would only result in a partial elimination.</p>

<p>The exercise of a SAR will result in the delivery of cash or stock to the employee, the value of which will be based on the difference between the strike of the SAR when granted and the current FMV of the stock. The spread between the exercise price and FMV is taxed as compensation.</p>
