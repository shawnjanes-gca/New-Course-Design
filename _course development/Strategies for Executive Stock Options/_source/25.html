<blockquote>
<p>Grants of <strong><em>Restricted Stock (RS)</em></strong>, sometimes referred to as <strong><em>Restricted Stock Awards</em></strong>, involve an employer granting employees company stock that is governed by a vesting period during which there are specific restrictions limiting the resale of the stock awarded and which generally provide for forfeiture in the event that the employee quits working for the employer prior to vesting. Vesting periods for Restricted Stock Awards may be time-based (i.e., after a stated period from the grant date). When a Restricted Stock Award vests, the employee receives the shares of company stock without restriction.</p>
<p>Because the shares are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the employee has no immediate tax burden. Once the vesting requirements are met, which are most typically based on maintaining employment with the company, the employee owns the shares outright and can dispose of them at his or her discretion. As the shares are owned free and clear, vesting triggers a taxable event. The employee must pay tax on the FMV of the securities at the time the grant vests.</p>

<p>Vesting is a taxable event. The tax is based on the FMV of the securities (taxed as ordinary income) at the time the grant vests and the substantial risk of forfeiture lapses. If the shares are held, the basis becomes the FMV at when the shares vested.</p>

<p>There is no "exercise" with Restricted Stock awards, as the award is made in stock and not as an option to purchase the stock at a given price.</p>

<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>The employee can sell the stock award at any time following the vesting. Even if a participant wishes to hold the shares after vesting, a portion of the vested shares will be sold to pay the taxes and the participant will hold the balance of the shares. Should the securities be held for one year and a day from the time of vesting until sale, the incremental value above FMV at vesting would be taxed as a long-term capital gain. Otherwise, it would be taxed as a short-term capital gain. The same logic would apply to a decline in the value of the shares; resulting in long- or short-term capital losses.</p>
