<p>There are several reasons why a company would issue Restricted Stock (RS) or Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) instead of Employee Stock Options (ESOs). First, unless the company stock goes to zero, both Restricted Stock Awards and RSUs always have value. Employee Stock Options, on the other hand, can go "underwater," or said another way, the FMV can fall below the strike price, thereby eliminating the intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Although the leverage imbedded in Executive Stock Options is very attractive, it is only of value if the stock price is appreciating, as the FMV must increase above the strike to generate revenue from the award. For companies whose stock price is flat or declining, Restricted Stock and RSUs provide a greater award than ESOs. Restricted Stock and RSUs are also a lot simpler to communicate to employees than ESOs, as there is no exercise decision, no need for financing, and no complex AMT issues.</p>
