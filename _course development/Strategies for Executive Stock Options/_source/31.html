<p>As previously discussed, individuals who received equity compensation are frequently concentrated in the company stock. If the goal is diversification, RS and RSUs should generally be sold at vesting. In addition to providing liquidity for diversification, it will also provide the funds necessary to pay the taxes which will be due at vesting.</p>
<p>In the case where the individual has multiple forms of company stock, the order of diversification is generally as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sell RS or RSUs at vesting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell long shares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise and sell NQSOs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise ISOs, sell if concentration is severe, hold if tax benefits make the additional risk worthwhile and the outlook on the stock is positive</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind, each situation is unique and these are just general guidelines. It is suggested you discuss the specifics of the client's position with a specialist to determine the appropriate course of action.</p>
