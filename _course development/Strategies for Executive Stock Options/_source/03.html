<p>Many people prefer to have a portion of their compensation in some form of equity in the firm for which they are working. This is an attractive alternative for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Equity compensation provides an opportunity to participate in the future growth of a company without having to make an investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible to defer the recognition of income and, therefore, taxes to a future date. This is particularly true for incentive stock options, which will be explained in this course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For employees, some stock options can offer the opportunity for the appreciation to be taxed at long-term capital gains tax rates rather than as ordinary income, provided certain requirements are met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock options provide a form of "leveraged investment," which can result in rapid appreciation as the stock price appreciates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
