<h2>The AMT Credit</h2>

<p>First, the good news. Generally when all or a portion of Alternative Minimum Tax that is attributable to deferred tax benefits, such as in Incentive Stock Options and Depreciation, is paid, an AMT credit is received. Now the bad news. This credit is notoriously difficult to use and, even when one can use it, it usually takes years to redeem. The problem lies in the fact that the AMT credit does not work like most tax credits where it will offset the tax dollar-for-dollar. An AMT credit can only be used when there is no AMT owed and only up to the point at which AMT would be due.</p>
<p>Returning to our earlier example, assume $15,940 was paid in AMT and, therefore, a $15,940 AMT credit would be recorded for possible future use. Let's suppose that next year, the individual again has $45,000 in taxes under the AMT calculation and $50,000 under the regular tax calculation. Without the credit, the individual would simply pay the $50,000 of regular income tax (since it is higher than the AMT). But since the individual does have an AMT credit, the individual can apply the credit against the regular income tax to the degree that the AMT is less than the regular income tax (e.g., $50,000 - $45,000 = $5,000 of credit that can be applied). Thus, the regular tax will be reduced from $50,000 to $45,000 and the individual, having used $5,000 of the credit, would have a remaining credit of $10,940 to carry forward. As you can see, if the individual's tax situation remained the same, it would take approximately 4 years to fully redeem the credit.</p>
<h4>AMT Relief</h4>
<p>As more people in the middle class end up in AMT each year, Congress is under pressure to fix the tax. In recent years, Congress has &ldquo;patched&rdquo; the AMT by increasing the flat deduction amount which, therefore, reduces the number of people who must pay the tax. As part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), the AMT is now permanently adjusted for inflation.</p>
