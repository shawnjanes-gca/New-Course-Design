<p>Suppose an individual's regular income tax in a given year is $50,000 and the Alternative Minimum Tax calculation is $45,500. No AMT tax would be due.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that same individual had exercised $100,000 worth of ISOs, paying $27,000 to exercise. This will not change the ordinary tax calculation; however, the AMT income will increase by $73,000 because the difference between the strike and the exercise of the option is a "preference item" in the AMT calculations and is added in as income for purposes of AMT.</p>
<p>If the AMT was $45,500 without the exercise of the ISOs, and if the additional $73,000 of AMT income is taxed at 28%, the AMT is increased to $65,940 (assuming all other calculations remained the same). In this situation, the individual will have a pre-credit AMT of $65,940. If there is no AMT credit available, the AMT will be $65,940. Since this is higher than the regular income tax, the individual will owe a regular income tax of $50,000 plus an AMT of $15,940.</p>
