<blockquote>
<p>As previously identified, there is no formal "exercise" with RSUs. Upon vesting in the RSUs, the individual simply receives the shares (or cash equivalent) and the tax liability is recognized (unless receipt of the securities is deferred). If receipt is deferred, the individual must pay a statutory minimum tax, as determined by the employer at vesting, but all other taxes are deferred until actual receipt of the stock or cash. This is a strategy that is most commonly used when a senior executive at a firm vests in RSUs.</p>
<p>Unless an amount is paid by the individual for the shares, which is very rare, the entire value of the stock upon receipt is taxed as ordinary income. If a payment is required, the difference between that amount and the FMV at vesting is taxed as ordinary income. In either case, the cost basis becomes the FMV at vesting.</p>
