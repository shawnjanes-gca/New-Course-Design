    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Many people prefer to have a portion of their compensation in some form of equity in the firm for which they are working. This is an attractive alternative for a number of reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Equity compensation provides an opportunity to participate in the future growth of a company       without having to make an investment.</li>
    <li>It is possible to defer the recognition of income and, therefore, taxes to a future date. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>This is particularly true for incentive stock options, which will be explained in this course.</li>
      <li>For employees, some stock options can offer the opportunity for the appreciation to be taxed at        long-term capital gains tax rates rather than as ordinary income, provided certain requirements are met. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Stock options provide a form of "leveraged investment," which can result in rapid appreciation as       the stock price appreciates.</li>
  </ul>
