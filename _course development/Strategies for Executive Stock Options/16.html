<h2>Avoiding AMT Associated with Incentive Stock Options</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the difficult decisions regarding ISOs is determining when to exercise the options. An argument for exercising early is that the holding period for capital gains purposes starts running. An argument against exercising early, at least before there has been considerable appreciation above the exercise price, is that you own the stock once exercised and are subject to capital losses. Nevertheless, one factor that should be considered each year is how many shares can be exercised without generating the AMT. Because AMT can generate a tax bill in the year of exercise, it is wise to give consideration each year to taking advantage of the number of shares that can be exercised before generating AMT.</p>
<p>To identify the number of options to exercise, the option holder can work with his or her tax advisor as year-end approaches to estimate the ordinary income tax on IRS Form 1040 and the AMT on IRS Form 6251. For purposes of illustration, suppose the regular tax estimate comes to $50,000 and the AMT calculation comes to $40,000. This gives a tax difference of $10,000. Whenever the AMT is less than the regular tax, this presents a window of opportunity for exercising options without generating AMT. As shares are exercised, the spread on the stock is added to the AMT calculation and are taxed at 26% or 28% (or some of both), depending upon the level of the AMT Tax Base less any exemption. Once the appropriate tax rate of 26% or 28% is identified, it becomes possible to estimate how many shares can be exercised before the AMT increases beyond the regular tax calculation. Note that because the standard deduction under the AMT is phased out for certain income levels, this is nothing more than a rough estimate of the actual tax that might be due. The client's tax advisor should provide a detailed calculation.</p>

<p>To illustrate, suppose the stock options in question make it possible to purchase 10,000 shares at $10 per share, with a current market value of $20 per share, giving a spread upon exercise for AMT purposes of $10 per share. If the AMT estimate is $10,000 below the regular income tax calculation, we can estimate the number of shares that can be exercised without generating AMT as follows:</p>

<p>Note that many clients have income from capital gains, qualified dividends, incentive stock options, and interest from tax-exempt private activity bonds that may actually trigger an alternative minimum tax liability. Thus, the financial professional and client cannot necessarily assume that a capital gain or qualified dividends will be taxed at 15%. Especially with affluent and high net worth clients, be careful about making assumptions regarding their actual income tax bracket (federal plus <em>state</em>) when the actual marginal tax rate affects an investment's rate of return.</p>
<p><strong>Tax planning relative to the Alternative Minimum Tax is very complex. We strongly recommend that any planning involving AMT include the participation of highly-qualified tax counsel. Today, this will potentially involve most affluent and almost all high net worth clients. Be especially attentive to clients that own municipal bond portfolios, receive qualified dividends, have capital gains or capital transactions, or Incentive Stock Options. </strong></p>
