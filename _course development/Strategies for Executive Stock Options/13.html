<h2>How is AMT calculated for Non-Corporate Taxpayers?</h2>

<td bgcolor="#E7E6CF">
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start with the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) after the Standard or Itemized Deductions have been subtracted from AGI (IRS Form 1040, line 41 - this is before personal exemptions, which are not allowed in the AMT calculation).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#DBD9B9">
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Add back (or maybe subtract) certain "adjustments" or "tax preference items". See IRS Form 6251 and instructions for details. Examples of the more common adjustments and tax preference items are listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ADD - Standard deduction if taxpayer does not itemize deductions</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>If Taxpayer uses Itemized Deductions:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ADD - Medical and Dental itemized deductions that exceed 7&frac12;% of AGI and are less than 10% of AGI.</p>
<p>ADD - State, local, property, sales tax deductions</p>
<p>ADD - Interest on mortgage borrowings NOT used to buy, build, or improve your primary residence</p>
<p>ADD - Certain investment interest deductions</p>
<p>ADD - Certain miscellaneous itemized deductions</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Other common adjustments/tax preference items:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ADD - With Incentive Stock Options, the excess of the fair market value of the stock over the amount paid for the stock when the option is exercised is usually treated as a tax preference item</p>
<p>ADD - Interest from certain private activity bonds that are exempt from the regular tax</p>
<p>ADD - For most types of property placed in service before 1987, the excess of accelerated depreciation over straight-line depreciation</p>
<p>ADD - Certain adjustments to passive activity losses</p>
<p>ADD - Certain Intangible Drilling costs and Depletion allowances</p>
<p>SUBTRACT - State or local income tax refunds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The completion of Step 1 and Step 2 becomes the "tax base" for calculation of the AMT.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp;</strong>Next, the amount of the basic exemption is calculated and subtracted from the AMT tax base. In 2015, the basic exemption for the AMT is $83,400 for joint returns (MFJ) and $53,600 for single returns. The exemption amounts, however, are phased out over certain income ranges (e.g., in excess of $158,900 in 2015 for MFJ taxpayers).</p>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#DBD9B9">
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A two-tiered tax rate structure of 26% and 28% is then assessed against the remaining AMT tax base to determine AMT tax liability. Note that these rates are less than the maximum regular tax rate of 39.6%. However, as you can see from some of the AMT adjustments and addition of tax preference items, the AMT Tax Base can be substantially higher than regular taxable income</p>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#E7E6CF">
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Certain foreign tax credits and certain other credits may be allowed that may reduce the taxpayer's AMT.</p>
<p>In determining if there is an actual AMT liability, the total tax calculated by the regular income tax and the AMT are compared. If the regular income tax is greater, that amount is paid and there is no alternative minimum tax due. If the alternative minimum tax amount is greater, the regular income tax is paid and then the difference between the minimum tax and the regular income tax is <em>added </em>as alternative minimum tax.</p>
