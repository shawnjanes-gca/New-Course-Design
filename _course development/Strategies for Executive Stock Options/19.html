<p>The spread on the stock's value at exercise is a tax preference item for purposes of the AMT calculation, which may result in an additional tax if the AMT exceeds the regular income tax calculation. If there is AMT tax attributable to an ISO exercise, the AMT paid can be treated as a credit in future years to the extent that regular income tax exceeds the AMT in any given year.</p>
