<p>With the previous detailed understanding of compensatory stock options completed, we now turn to some of the other forms of equity-based compensation strategies that are commonly used in the marketplace.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restricted Stock Awards (RS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance Shares</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While in some respects similar to stock options, there are unique differences in terms of the structure of these various compensation strategies and very significant tax implications that you should be aware of as a financial professional.</p>
<p>Grants of Restricted Stock, RSUs, and Performance Shares involve a grant as well as a vesting schedule or vesting condition. For RS, the vesting schedule is time-based, similar to ISOs and NQSOs. Performance shares are essentially the same as RS except the timing of their vesting or the quantity of shares vesting, which is based on some type of performance criteria. RSUs most often are time-based, but some can be subject to performance criteria as well.</p>
<p>On the following pages, we will take a closer look at these compensation strategies. As you study these types of equity-based compensation strategies, make sure you understand the structure of the awards, the vesting and exercise strategies related to each, as well as the tax implications and strategies that should be discussed with clients receiving these forms of compensation.</p>
