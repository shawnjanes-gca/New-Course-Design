<p>While ISOs can provide significant income tax benefits to employees, there are some critical issues to consider - particularly the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). AMT is a complex tax system that runs parallel to the regular tax system. It was created in the 1970's to ensure that the wealthy, some of whom used substantial income tax deductions, still paid taxes. Note that the AMT system was not indexed for inflation and it was implemented when the regular income tax rates were considerably higher. These two factors have resulted in an increasing number of taxpayers paying the AMT each year.</p>
<h4>Understanding the basics of the AMT</h4>
<p>The Individual Income Tax is calculated two ways: First, under the regular income tax system and then under the Alternative Minimum Tax system. There are two primary differences between the two systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Difference #1:</strong> With regular income tax calculations, each individual has the ability to utilize numerous adjustments and deductions that reduce the taxable income, e.g., deductions for charitable gifts, home mortgage interest paid, etc. With the AMT calculation, many of these adjustments and deductions are added back to regular taxable income. Therefore, if there were sizeable adjustments and/or deductions in the calculation of the regular income tax, the denial of those adjustments in the AMT calculation may generate a higher tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Difference #2:</strong> The second difference is most significant, such as when a taxpayer exercises an Incentive Stock Option. There are no regular income tax consequences upon the exercise of ISOs even though economic value was realized by the taxpayer. However, under the AMT tax calculation, when certain items of economic value are derived, like ISO exercise, they are termed "tax preference items" and are includable in income for the AMT calculation. For many people with ISOs, the exercise of those options in any given year could cause the client to slip into a position where they have AMT liability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
