    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>When people think of estate planning, most people think of writing a will. Others might include creating a trust. And still others might think in terms of minimizing estate taxes. But all these considerations miss the point that estate planning is really about fulfilling one's personal goals regarding one's financial resources and assets.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Purpose of Estate Planning</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>To give what you want, to whom you want, when you want</li>
      <li>To minimize taxes and administrative costs</li>
      <li>To minimize probate expenses</li>
      <li>To provide protection for one's self and beneficiaries</li>
      <li>To provide control after death</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Defining Personal Goals</h3>
  <p>The process should always begin with the very personal task of identification of goals. Some of these goals may be lifetime goals, such as protection against incapacity by establishing a living trust; others might extend beyond the grave, such as providing for the continued care of a child or dependent with special needs. Along the way, the estate planner (i.e., the attorney) can facilitate the process by informing the client of options and costs associated with the goals identified; but always, the person's personal goals should reign supreme. </p>
  <p>Only when the goals are identified can the planner begin identifying the most tax efficient means of achieving those goals. This will be the focus of this module, identifying the basic tools and techniques that can improve the tax-effectiveness of the estate plan. </p>
  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <p>Once personal goals are identified, implementation of an estate plan to accomplish those goals requires the drafting of legal documents that take into consideration, where necessary, strategies to minimize estate taxes. Therefore, in its strictest sense, it involves the practice of law, with the client's attorney ultimately responsible for the plan. But an effective financial adviser works in concert with the attorney, facilitating the development of a viable plan, while avoiding the unauthorized practice of law.</p>
  <p>This course will examine those legal documents and some of the fundamental strategies that are employed to minimize estate taxes.</p>
