<h2>When NOT to Rely on Portability</h2>

<p>Certainly, things have become simpler since 2011 when portability of the DSUE was introduced. This in no way negates the use of the Credit Shelter Trust or Marital Trust in today&rsquo;s environment. In fact, there are situations when they are still preferred to relying solely on portability of the DSUE. The following is a list of some common situations where one should not overly rely upon portability. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click each situation to learn more.</strong></p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_1" href="javascript:;"><strong>Second Marriages Involving Children of a Prior Marriage </strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>When this is the case, &nbsp;it will typically be desirable to create a Credit Shelter Trust or an A-B Trust arrangement where a Credit Shelter Trust is coupled with a QTIP Marital Trust. In this manner, all the assets can be available to support the surviving spouse, but each spouse will be able to ultimately preserve their own assets for children of a prior marriage.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" href="javascript:;"><strong>States with an Estate Tax and No Portability</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Many states have an estate or inheritance tax. They generally provide a credit against the tax, similar to the Federal Applicable Credit Amount, but the size of the credit is typically much smaller (e.g., protecting $1 million) and states have been slow to adopt the concept of portability of the credit between spouses.</p>
<p>For situations where there is a state tax but no portability of the state tax credit, a Credit Shelter Trust should be considered. This trust would be funded up to the limit that can be protected by the state credit. Part of the Federal Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount would also be applied to the Credit Shelter Trust, thereby protecting the trust from both state and federal taxes. The balance of the DSUE can then be &ldquo;ported&rdquo; over to the surviving spouse or placed in a marital trust for the surviving spouse&rsquo;s benefit.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>There may be times when it is desirable to fund trusts at death to support personal goals, such as the care of a handicapped child or the establishment of a trust for grandchildren. In such situations, it may be preferred to use the Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount (either in total or in part) to protect these trusts from transfer taxation, allowing the balance to be deferred through the unlimited marital deduction.</p>

<p>While it is beyond the scope of this course, portability is not available when the surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen. In this situation, special planning is needed.</p>
