<p><strong>In funding the Marital Trust, the executor makes the QTIP election on the estate tax return. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.</strong></p>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The surviving spouse may have a limited power of appointment. In this regard, it is most typical to give the spouse a testamentary power to appoint the assets among the children. This is particularly useful when there are minor children involved. This way, as they grow and mature, the surviving spouse can make adjustments on the basis of need, merit, or to adjust for assistance they previously received. In some circumstances, such testamentary power might provide assurance that the surviving spouse would not be neglected by adult children due to their fear of being disinherited if they did so. </strong></p>
