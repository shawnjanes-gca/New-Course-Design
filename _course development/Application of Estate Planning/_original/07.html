<p>For taxable estates, one of the best ways to manage transfer tax exposure is through lifetime gifts. Making non-taxable gifts like those listed on this page can be a means of achieving long-term goals while also reducing the size of the estate that is potentially subject to taxation. Even lifetime gifts that are &ldquo;taxable&rdquo; and use up part of one&rsquo;s Applicable Exclusion Amount to avoid paying a tax can be a means of transferring future appreciation out of one&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>In 2016, there are no taxes due on gifts up to $14,000 per year ($28,000 if gifted by a married couple), no gift tax on gifts to a U.S. citizen spouse, and no gift tax on gifts to charities. Furthermore, gifts made in direct payment of tuition and medical care are also excluded from gift taxes when paid directly to the school or medical service provider. None of these gifts require use of the Applicable Exclusion Amount to avoid transfer taxes and none of them will be added back at death as post-1976 taxable gifts to be included on the estate tax return.</p>
