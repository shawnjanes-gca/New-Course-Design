    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>An irrevocable trust that is funded with assets that are covered by the Applicable Credit Amount. Typically used to "shelter" assets from the surviving spouse's estate for federal estate tax purposes.</p>
    <h3>When?</h3>
    <p>Typically, funding takes place after death.</p>
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>Typically, when the first spouse dies, those assets that are covered by the Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount are transferred into the trust. No federal estate tax is paid on these assets, and they are not included in the surviving spouse's estate for federal estate tax purposes.</p>
    <p>The remaining assets are transferred to the surviving spouse or into a Marital Trust. Since there is an unlimited marital deduction, no taxes are paid on this transfer, but these assets will be included in the surviving spouse's estate.</p>
    <p>Often created in conjunction with a Marital Trust (often referred to as an A-B trust arrangement, where the "A" trust is the Marital Trust and the "B" trust is the Credit Shelter Trust). </p>
    <p>It can be created in the will or upon the death of the grantor of a revocable living trust, where the living trust splits into an A-B trust. </p>

        <td style="vertical-align:top;">Before portability, it allowed married couples to make use of both individuals' Applicable Credit Amounts without denying the surviving spouse the benefit of the combined estate.</td>
        <td style="vertical-align:top;">Not necessary if the combined estates of husband and wife are below the Applicable Exclusion Amount. Also, not necessary beginning in 2011 when portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount allows the surviving spouse to inherit the Unused Spousal Applicable Exclusion Amount.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align:top;"><p>Since portability came into effect in 2011, it may still be an effective tool for specific situations, such as second marriages, protection against creditors, or to create a generation-skipping transfer (GST) trust (since the GST exemption is not portable).</p>
<p>While a Credit Shelter Trust may not be needed for federal estate taxes, it might still be needed for state taxes where portability does not exist.</p>
</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Other Considerations.</h3>
    <p>To prevent the assets from being included in the surviving spouse's estate, the surviving spouse cannot have unrestricted control (or have a general power of appointment) over the assets of the Credit Shelter Trust.  However, the surviving spouse may act as trustee and may receive benefits from the trust per the terms of the trust. </p>
    <p>This is typically thought of as a "family trust", providing benefits for the surviving spouse and children, while keeping it out of the surviving spouse's estate. It can terminate upon the surviving spouse's death or continue for other members of the family, whichever the grantor/testator prefers. </p>
    <p>While the Credit Shelter Trust will shelter assets from the federal estate tax, there may still be a state estate tax on the assets. State estate tax ramifications will vary from state to state.</p>
