<h2>Using a Charitable Remainder Trust</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously there must be charitable intent for charitable remainder trusts to be considered. But where that is the case, they take some of the risk out of making lifetime gifts for persons who are concerned about loss of income. In fact, they can be particularly advantageous in certain circumstances.</p>
<h3>Highly Appreciated or Low Income Producing Property</h3>
<p>The greatest benefit to utilizing a Charitable Remainder Trust is when you are dealing with highly appreciated long-term capital gain property and/or property that provides a very low income. Both of these factors are illustrated in the following scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Thurmond&rsquo;s Story </strong></p>
<p>Mrs. Thurmond was given 100 shares of ABC Company on her 18th birthday. That was 60 years ago! Affected by the Great Depression, this is the only stock she has ever owned. It has split eight times since she received it, now giving her 25,600 shares with a market value of approximately $1,000,000. Her basis is only pennies per share.</p>
<p>Her estate is worth $8 million, some of which is land that she plans to pass on to her children. And her current income is $200,000 per year, of which ABC stock provides $20,000. Her arthritis is requiring her to have some live-in assistance, and she needs to generate an additional $50,000 of income to cover all expenses. She would not be opposed to selling the ABC stock, but does not want to pay the tax bill that will be generated by the realized capital gain on the sale.</p>
<p>Her will states her intent to give a substantial portion of her estate to charity, but she has been rather hesitant to give much during her lifetime out of fear of not having enough to meet her needs.*</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurmond creates a Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust with a 7% payout. The trust can then sell the security, diversify the portfolio, and distribute $70,000 per year to her. Mrs. Thurmond now has the income she needs. No capital gains tax will be generated by the transfer, although over time the gains may be distributed back to her as they are needed to supplement the accumulated investment income in order to meet the required payout, but at least they will be deferred. &nbsp;She may expect to also pay far less income taxes in the current year due to the charitable deduction. More important, she has met both her income need and fulfilled her charitable intent.</p>
