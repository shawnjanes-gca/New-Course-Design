  <h1><span class="pagetitle">What if the Surviving Spouse is not a U.S. Citizen?</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Thus far, we have assumed that the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen. That is a big assumption because there is no marital deduction for gifts to a non-citizen spouse.  However, the annual amount that can be transferred to a non-citizen spouse without gift taxes is $148,000 in 2016. This amount is indexed for inflation, and may change from year to year. So, while this makes it possible to make lifetime transfers, there is no unlimited marital deduction that can be used to fund a Marital Trust. This limit exists to prevent the surviving spouse from inheriting everything and then transferring the money out of the country and away from taxation. </p>
  <p>For a surviving spouse who is not a U.S. citizen, the most popular solution is a Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT). Essentially, a QDOT accomplishes four things. </p>

              <p>Obviously, not transferring assets to the surviving spouse's estate and taxing non-hardship distributions to the spouse goes a long way toward preventing this. But in addition, two other steps were taken to protect against the possible loss of tax revenue: </p>
              <ol type="A" style="width:95%;">
              <li><span><strong>One of the trustees must be a U.S. citizen or  U.S. corporation.</strong> This is the trustee who must make all decisions regarding  distribution of principal and who has the power to withhold estate taxes on the  distribution. In fact, this trustee is personally liable for the tax.</span></li>
            <li><span><strong>If the U.S. trustee is not a U.S. bank, then the trustee may  be required to furnish a bond or security to the IRS</strong>. This is not required if  the QDOT is $2 million or less, provided there is a clause in the trust that  restricts investments in foreign real property to no more than 35% of the FMV  of the trust, as determined annually. In all other situations, the non-bank  U.S. trustee must furnish 65% of the FMV of the trust assets, as determined at  the time of death.</span></li>
