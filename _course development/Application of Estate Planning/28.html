<h2>The Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</h2>

<p>Finally, the last strategy we shall discuss for reducing the size of a taxable estate is the deployment of an <strong><em>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</em></strong><strong><em>. </em></strong>This <strong></strong>is an irrevocable trust with language that makes it possible for the trustee to buy and hold life insurance.&nbsp; The trust is named the owner and beneficiary of life insurance for purposes of keeping life insurance outside of the grantor's estate. Alternatively, such trusts are often referred to as <strong><em>Wealth Replacement Trusts </em></strong>or <strong><em>Asset Replacement Trusts</em></strong> because they are used to replace some of the wealth or assets that are eroded by estate taxes or charitable transfers.</p>

<p>The grantor creates an irrevocable trust, typically naming family members as the trust beneficiaries. Next, the grantor either transfers a life insurance policy(ies) or contributes funds that may be used to purchase life insurance. The trust is named as the owner and beneficiary of the insurance policy. So long as the grantor avoids all incidents of ownership, e.g., is not named as the trustee, has no power to direct the trustee, and has no beneficial interest in the trust, then the insurance policy will not be included in the grantor's estate upon the grantor's death.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware of the &ldquo;three-year rule.&rdquo; </strong>If the policy is transferred by the grantor, the grantor must live three years after the transfer to avoid the three-year rule, which will return the policy back to the grantor's estate if the transfer is made within three years of death. Furthermore, there may be gift tax implications with transferring an existing policy. For these reasons, as long as the grantor is currently insurable, it is generally preferable to have the trust purchase a new policy with contributed cash.</p>

<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Typically, the sole asset of the trust is the insurance policy. Therefore, the grantor needs to make periodic contributions to the trust, thereby providing the trust with the funds to pay the premiums.</p>
<p>This presents a potential problem because the beneficiaris of the trust receive no benefits until the grantor dies; in other words, they have a &ldquo;future interest.&rdquo; Only gifts of a &ldquo;present interest,&rdquo; meaning they must have the right to presently use and enjoy the funds, will qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion.</p>
<p>Unless we can find a way to give the benefiaries a &ldquo;present interest&rdquo; in the contributed funds, the contributions will be taxable gifts, requiring the grantor to file a gift tax return and use up part of the Applicable Credit Amount. In the next step, we show how we give them a &ldquo;present&rdquo; interest, thereby making the contributions annual exclusion gifts and therefore nontaxable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_4" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>To qualify the contributions for the annual gift tax exclusion, a <strong>"Crummey Power"</strong> is provided to the beneficiaries in the trust document, which gives them a &ldquo;present interest&rdquo; for a limited time (typically 30 days) following each contribution, during which the beneficiaries may remove the funds for their own use. Note, the term &ldquo;Crummey&rdquo; comes from the last name of the person whom the IRS took to court seeking to outlaw this procedure; the IRS lost the case and the court ruling set the precedent for utilizing this technique.</p>
<p>Therefore, upon receipt of the contributed funds, the trustee writes "<strong><em>Crummey Letters</em></strong>" to the beneficiaries, notifying them of the contribution and their temporary right to remove their portion of the contribution. Provided they do not remove the funds, their current interest lapses at the end of the time period, and the Trustee can use the funds to pay the premiums.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To qualify the entire contribution as one or more annual exclusion gifts, you need to have sufficient beneficiaries named in the trust to fully cover the amount of the contribution. In other words, the number of beneficiaries multiplied by the amount of the current annual gift tax exclusion amount must total greater than the amount being contributed.</p>

<p>Upon the death of the grantor, the trust receives the insurance proceeds and the trustee will administer or distribute the funds as directed by the terms of the trust.</p>
