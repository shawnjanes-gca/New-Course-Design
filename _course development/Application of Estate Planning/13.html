  	<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>General Power of Appointment (POA) Marital Trust</strong></p>
    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>An irrevocable trust for the surviving spouse that qualifies for the marital deduction by giving the surviving spouse a general power of appointment over the trust assets (thereby including the trust assets in the surviving spouse's taxable estate).</p>
    <h3>When?</h3>
    <p>Funding takes place after the first spouse's death.</p>
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <ul type="disc" style="width:95%;">
      <li>May be created in the will or upon the death of the grantor of a revocable living trust.</li>
      <li>The surviving spouse must receive the net income, which must be paid at least annually.</li>
      <li>The surviving spouse must have a general power of appointment to appoint the property to anyone,       including himself/herself. Depending on the trust document, this power may be exercisable only during life (if unexercised, it is distributed as the trust dictates), at death, or both.

          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align:top;">Frees the surviving spouse from the burden of managing the assets.</td>
            <td style="vertical-align:top;">When both spouses are remarried, each with children from a former marriage, donor may prefer to designate that assets ultimately transfer to donor's own children. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          	<td style="vertical-align:top;">When it is considered desirable for the named remainder beneficiaries to be aware that how they treat the surviving spouse could impact whether or not he/she exercises the general power of appointment to take away their interest in the trust.</td>
            <td style="vertical-align:top;">If there is risk that the surviving spouse may be subject to undue influence regarding the POA.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ul>
	<h3>Other Considerations.</h3>
	<ul type="disc">
	  <li>By giving a lifetime power of appointment, the surviving spouse can further reduce the size of the       estate through lifetime gifts. </li>
	  <li>If given a general power of appointment at death, the optional lifetime power may be limited (for       example, only allowing for gifts to children).</li>
      <li>If the spouse doesn't  exercise the general power of appointment, the trust document will direct the  final transfer of assets.</li>
