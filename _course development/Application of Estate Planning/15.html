  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>QTIP (Qualified Terminable Interest Property) Trust</strong></p>
  <h3>What?</h3>
  <p>An irrevocable trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse that qualifies for the marital deduction, while limiting the power of the surviving spouse to appoint the assets, either during life or at death.</p>
  <h3>When?</h3>
  <p>Funding takes place after the first spouse's death.</p>
  <h3>How?</h3>
  <p>In funding the Marital Trust, the executor makes the QTIP election on the estate tax return.</p>
	<p>The surviving spouse MUST receive the net income.</p>
	<p>Principal can ONLY be used for the benefit of the surviving spouse. </p>

        <td style="vertical-align:top;">For smaller estates, it may be more cost effective to make the transfer outright to the surviving spouse.</td>

      <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align:top;">Especially useful when both spouses have been previously married, with children from prior marriages, and they want to keep their respective estates separate for their children while taking advantage of the marital deduction.</td>
        <td style="vertical-align:top;">If the surviving spouse might potentially need to use the assets to assist other family members, a General POA marital might be preferred because of the restriction on a QTIP Marital Trust to use principal exclusively for the surviving spouse.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align:top;">Also useful to protect the estate from a subsequent remarriage. </td>

    <h3>Other Considerations.</h3>
    <p>The surviving spouse may have a limited power of appointment. In this regard, it is most typical to give the spouse a testamentary power to appoint the assets among the children. This is particularly useful when there are minor children involved. This way, as they grow and mature, the surviving spouse can make adjustments on the basis of need, merit, or to adjust for assistance they previously received. In some circumstances, such testamentary power might provide assurance that the surviving spouse would not be neglected by adult children due to their fear of being disinherited if they did so. </p>
