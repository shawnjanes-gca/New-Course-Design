<p><strong>WHAT?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An irrevocable trust used to defer payment of estate taxes through the lifetime of a surviving spouse who is not a U.S. citizen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> WHEN?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Used when the surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen, which prevents funding of a Marital Trust through use of the unlimited marital deduction. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HOW? </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Executor must make the election on the estate tax return. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The terms of the trust must be such that the transfer of assets would meet the same deductibility requirements that would be required with a domestic spouse. For example, the terms would be such that it would meet the requirements of a Marital Trust except for the fact that the surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The surviving spouse receives the income, but principal distributions must be at the discretion of a trustee who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. corporation with the power to withhold taxes on distributions of principal. In fact, the U.S. trustee is individually liable for the tax. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Estate taxes must be withheld and paid on all distributions of principal that occur, provided they are not for hardship situations where there is no other readily available source of funds. Hardship distributions must be for the health, maintenance, education or support for the surviving spouse or for someone the surviving spouse is legally obligated to support, such as a son or daughter who is a minor.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Estate taxes will be due on the assets of the trust upon the death of the surviving non-citizen spouse. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the U.S. trustee is not a U.S. bank, the IRS may require a security arrangement. This is not required for QDOTs of $2 million or less, provided the trust prohibits investments in foreign real property from exceeding 35% of the FMV of the portfolio, as determined annually. But in all other situations, the non-bank U.S. trustee must furnish a bond or security to the IRS in the amount of 65% of the FMV of the trust assets, as determined at the time of death of the decedent. </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Estate and Gift tax treaties may exist between the U.S. and certain other countries, e.g., Canada, that may provide more flexibility than the QDOT. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If a QDOT was not provided for by the decedent or the terms of a trust to provide for the life of the surviving spouse do not meet its requirements, a QDOT can be established or revisions can be made to the trust prior to filing the estate tax return to remedy the situation. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The surviving spouse can be the sole trustee for all decisions other than distributions of principal, for which there must be a U.S. trustee. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annual gifts of up to $148,000 (in 2016) to a spouse who is not a U.S. citizen are excluded from transfer taxes. This provides an excellent opportunity to make lifetime transfers free of taxes.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The laws of some countries may prohibit the creation of trusts. In those cases, the IRS will generally accept legal arrangements that have substantially the same effect as a trust. </strong></p>
