  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Planning for Larger Estates of Married Couples Before the Advent of Portability</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Let's now examine a pre-portability example of a larger estate to learn some additional techniques that were widely utilized in conjunction with the Credit Shelter Trust prior to the advent of portability, but which have continued utility for today. </p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
    <h3>Example of Mr. and  Mrs. Dollar (2009)</h3>
     <p> In 2009, John and Susan Dollar, both U.S. citizens, were  both in their 70's. John was in poor health and was concerned that he might  predecease Susan, who has never handled any of the financial affairs, and he  feared she would be overwhelmed by having to handle things herself. They had  four grown children, all of whom were married with children of their own. Their  youngest son had recently been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  (Lou Gehrig's Disease), and John and Susan Dollar were providing financial  assistance to him and his family.</p>
     <p> John and Susan's combined estate was currently valued at  $9.5 million. Each had an Applicable Exclusion Amount in 2009 of $3.5 million.  How might they plan to minimize their estate tax exposure?* The following is  how this was typically done:</p>
 	<ol style="width:95%">
 		<li><span><strong>Split Assets</strong>
<p>Since they could not predict which would die first, they  would typically divide up assets, making sure that each spouse could use as  much of their Applicable Exclusion Amount as possible upon the first death. In  our example, let's assume that John and Susan divide assets equally, with each  spouse owning $4.75 million each.</p></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Create a Credit  Shelter Trust Upon the First Death</strong>
<p>Assuming the first spouse died in 2009 when the Applicable  Exclusion Amount was $3.5 million, then $3.5 million would go into the Credit  Shelter Trust upon the first death.</p></span></li>
  	<li><span><strong>Transfer Remaining  Assets to the Surviving Spouse</strong>
<p>After funding the Credit Shelter Trust, the first estate has  a taxable balance of $1.25 million. Rather than pay taxes in the first estate,  the taxes could be deferred by passing them on to the surviving spouse through  use of the unlimited marital deduction. This would provide the surviving spouse  time to do additional tax planning to reduce the size of the taxable estate,  which we shall discuss, prior to the assets being taxed upon the second  spouse's death.</p>
     <p> While  transferring  the remaining assets to the surviving spouse would defer taxation, many clients  preferred not to transfer assets outright in the hands of a surviving spouse.  This could be because the surviving spouse was not familiar with handling  assets and the client did not want to burden the surviving spouse.  Alternatively, this might be a second marriage and, while the client wished to  adequately support the surviving spouse, there was also the desire to assure  that the assets went to the deceased's own children from a prior marriage. So,  how does one defer taxation of assets that exceed what can placed in the Credit  Shelter Trust by utilizing the unlimited marital deduction, yet not make an  outright transfer to the surviving spouse?</p></span></li>
      <li><span><strong>(Alternative) –  Transfer Assets to a Marital Trust</strong>
<p>The answer that was commonly deployed was to utilize a <strong><em>Marital  Trust</em></strong>. This was typically referred to as A-B Trust planning, whereby a  Credit Shelter Trust was set up for the Family (the A Trust) and a Marital  Trust (the B Trust) would be set up for the benefit of the surviving spouse. </p>
     <p> The terms of the Marital Trust would be such that the assets  would be included in the surviving spouse's estate, thereby qualifying the  trust for the unlimited marital deduction. In this manner, taxation of the Marital  Trust would be deferred until the second death, just as occurred with an  outright transfer to the surviving spouse.</p>
     <p> Two types of Marital  Trusts were commonly used: the <strong>General  Power of Appointment (POA) Marital Trust</strong> and the <strong>Qualified Terminal Interest Property (QTIP) Marital Trust</strong>. Both  continue to have utility today for those situations where the preference is NOT  to leave assets outright to the surviving spouse. We will discuss each type on  the following pages.</p></span></li>
