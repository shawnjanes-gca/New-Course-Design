  <p>Estate planning is very broad in scope and can be dense with details. It is often the intensity of details that makes it difficult to grasp the basic concepts that form the core of any estate plan. For that reason, this module will focus only on the fundamentals. </p>
  <p>The good news is that estate planning is an area where a little knowledge goes a long way. The basic principles that are covered in this module address the most common estate planning opportunities. Thus, in a relatively short time, one can master the skills necessary to address most situations, while building a solid foundation for continued learning. However, when discussing estate planning concepts with clients, it is important to remember that the client's attorney needs to be consulted in deciding the final course of action to be taken, as well as in the drafting and execution of estate planning documents.</p>
