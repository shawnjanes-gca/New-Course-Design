<p>U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and nonresident aliens (with assets in the U.S) are all subject to the federal gift and estate tax when making lifetime or at-death transfers of assets. However, the particular assets that are considered and the rules that apply will depend upon their citizenship or residential status. We will discuss some of the different rules as we go, but for now let&rsquo;s address the assets involved and how resident and nonresident alien status is determined.</p>
<h3>What Assets are Considered?</h3>
<p>Your status regarding citizenship or domicile will determine what assets are considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens (Non-Citizen Residents)</strong> are subject to the federal gift and estate tax on their <strong><em>entire estates wherever situated</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nonresident Aliens </strong>are subject to the federal gift and estate tax only on their<strong> <em>U.S. &ldquo;situs&rdquo; assets</em></strong>.<strong> </strong>Unless modified by treaty, this generally includes real and tangible personal property located in the U.S., business assets located in the U.S., and stocks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How is Resident and Nonresident Alien Status Determined</h3>
<p>For federal gift and estate tax purposes<sup>1</sup>, non-citizens are either resident aliens or nonresident aliens depending upon their domicile:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Resident Alien (Non-Citizen Resident)</strong> - A non-citizen person is considered a resident alien and domiciled in the United States if the person lives in the United States with no present intention of leaving the United States. Various factors, such as statements of intent, length of time in the U.S., visa status, etc.) are used to determine domicile. Resident aliens are generally under the same gift and estate tax rules as U.S. citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nonresident Alien </strong>- All other non-citizens who do not meet the test for being a resident alien are classified as nonresident aliens, even though they may be living in the United States for an extended period of time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 10px;"><em> <sup>1</sup>Please note that the determination of resident and nonresident status is different from the determination made for Federal Income Tax purposes.</em></p>
