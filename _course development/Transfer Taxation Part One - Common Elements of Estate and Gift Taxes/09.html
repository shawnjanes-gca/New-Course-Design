    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Every U.S. citizen and resident alien has a lifetime <strong><em>credit</em></strong> against gift and estate taxes; it is typically referred to as the "<strong><em>Applicable  Credit Amount</em></strong>." A "credit" is an amount that you get to <strong><em>subtract  after a tax is calculated</em></strong>. So, once we calculate a tentative transfer  tax, we get to subtract the credit from the calculated tax. </p>
<p>The Applicable Credit Amount is "<strong><em>unified</em></strong>," meaning it is  shared with lifetime transfers (i.e., gifts) and estate transfers (i.e., at  death); for this reason, you will sometimes see the Applicable Credit Amount  referred to as the "<strong><em>Unified Credit</em></strong>." Thus, the credit can be used to offset  calculated gift or estate taxes; but if it is all used up by lifetime taxable gifts,  there will be no credit left to protect further assets that transfer at death</p>
  <p>Historically, the Applicable Credit Amount has not always been fully unified between gift and estate taxes. In other words, there have been times in the past when only a portion of the Applicable Credit Amount could be used for lifetime taxable gifts; but today, there is no limit on how much of the credit can be used while alive.</p>
