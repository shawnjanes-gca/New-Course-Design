    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The outcome of the development of transfer taxation is that today we are left with three types of transfer taxes. </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Gift Tax </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Estate Tax </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This course will look at the first two types, gift and estate taxes, deferring the generation-skipping transfer tax to a subsequent course. Because the gift tax and estate tax have been "unified," they share many common elements. The following pages will look at these common elements, in some detail, to form the foundation for the subsequent course that will take a deeper look at elements that are unique to each.</p>
