  <p>The Federal Transfer Tax System addresses the <em>taxation on the personal transfer of assets</em> to individuals or entities. Depending upon such circumstances as the amount  being transferred, when it is transferred, the manner in which it is being  transferred, and the identify of the person or entity to whom it is being transferred, one or more transfer taxes may be accessed. This is true whether the transfer of assets happen during life or at death.</p>
<p>The Federal Transfer Tax System is composed of two parts: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>The</em></strong> <strong><em>Federal</em></strong> <strong><em>Gift  and Estate Tax</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GST  Tax or GSTT)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
  <p>Because of the scope of material, the study of transfer  taxation has been broken into segments, with the first two segments addressing  the Federal Gift and Estate Tax and the third segment addressing the Generation-Skipping  Transfer Tax. This first segment, Part I, will cover the history of transfer  taxation and the fundamental elements that are common to both gift taxes and  estate taxes. Subsequent lessons will expand this knowledge to address the  following subjects:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Part II – Unique Elements of Estate and Gift Taxes</li>
    <li>Part IV – Generation-Skipping Transfers</li>
  </ul>
<p>Because estate planning deals with planning for the transfer of assets, an understanding of transfer taxation is critical to understanding estate planning strategies. For this reason, knowledge of the material contained herein should be considered as prerequisite to studying more advanced estate planning topics.</p>
