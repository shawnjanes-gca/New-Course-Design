<h2>Unlimited Marital Deduction</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Under certain conditions, current federal transfer tax laws provide an <strong><em>unlimited marital deduction</em></strong> for transfers to a U.S. citizen spouse. This means that during life or at death a married person can transfer assets to his or her spouse free of any gift or estate taxes. Why does the IRS allow this? Because they know they will tax all the assets upon the last spouse&rsquo;s death. Thus, the unlimited marital deduction does not eliminate any transfer taxes on the spouses&rsquo; estates, but merely defers taxation until the last spouse&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The following conditions must be met to qualify for the marital deduction.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Citizenship</strong></p>
<p>The spouse receiving the assets must be a U.S. citizen. If the IRS were to allow the deduction when the spouse was not a U.S. citizen, there would be a risk that the assets would be removed from the country and thereby escape taxation upon the death of the surviving spouse.&nbsp; However, if the spouse is not a citizen at the decedent&rsquo;s death, but becomes a citizen by the time the 706 is filed, the marital deduction is allowable.</p>
<p>Note that this means that the transfer to the U.S. citizen spouse can come from another U.S. citizen spouse, from a resident alien spouse, or from a nonresident alien spouse. So long as the transfer is being made to a spouse who is a U.S. citizen, the the unlimited marital deduction is available</p>
<p>When the transfer is made to a non-citizen spouse, the unlimited marital deduction is not available. When one spouse dies, it is possible, however, to make a transfer to a Qualified Domestic Order Trust (QDOT Trust) that will qualify for the marital deduction, but that is a subject for later discussion. For current purposes, direct transfers to a non-citizen spouse simply do not qualify for the unlimited marital deduction.</p>

<p><strong>Survival of the Spouse</strong></p>
<p>For transfers to qualify at death, one spouse must be survived by the other. Presumption of survivorship must be stated in the will in the event both spouses die under circumstances that prevent determination of order of death (e.g., car accident, airplane crash, etc.).&nbsp; If not, the state statutes will govern survivorship. Under the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act, which has been adopted in many states, in the event of death within 120 hours of each other and no will that states order of death, then each spouse&rsquo;s estate would be settled as though there had been no surviving spouse, eliminating the use of the marital deduction for either spouse.</p>

<p><strong>Married</strong></p>
<p>One must be legally married in order to qualify for the marital deduction. With the Supreme Court ruling in June 2015, this includes same-sex marriages as well as opposite-sex marriages in all states.</p>
<p>Spouses who are legally separated are still married and, therefore, can pass assets via the marital deduction.</p>
