popUp="This schedule is for either the taxable estate OR for taxable gifts. But developing a common rate schedule that can be used for either can be a bit tricky, as the following example shows:\n"

popUp+="\n		Example: Mr. Jones made a taxable gift during his" 
popUp+="\n		lifetime (after 1976) of $800,000. He died in 2009 with" 
popUp+="\n		an estate valued at $2,200,000. How do you take into "
popUp+="\n		account his lifetime gift in computing his estate tax?" 

popUp+="\n\n		Answer: First, add together his lifetime taxable gifts "
popUp+="\n		(made after 1976) and his final estate value, deriving "
popUp+="\n		a total of $3 million. Then compute the tax on " 
popUp+="\n		$3 million, deriving his tentative estate tax. If he" 
popUp+="\n		paid any prior tax on his lifetime gift (a likelihood " 
popUp+="\n		if the gift was made prior to 2002 when the amount "
popUp+="\n		that could be gifted without paying a tax was  "
popUp+="\n		much smaller), give him a credit in that amount "
popUp+="\n		against his estate tax. "
popUp+="\n"
popUp+="\n"
        
popUp2='The tax on $2,000,000 would be $780,800. Therefore, having a credit of $780,800 would effectively “exclude” $2,000,000 from taxation.'

popUp3="The maximum rate on the table for 2009 is 45%. This is achieved on amounts over $1.5 million. While this is a decrease from the 55% maximum rate of 2001, it continues to provide strong incentive for taking advantage of every opportunity to avoid estate taxes through proper estate planning. " 

popUp4="The Incorrect Exclusion Calculation"
popUp4+="\n\nThe incorrect Exclusion calculation would reduce the taxable estate from $5,500,000 to $380,000." 
popUp4+="\n\nThis would leave the balance being taxed at the lower rates, thereby causing a lower tax bill." 
popUp4+="\n\nNote: The first taxable dollar would be at 18% if this approach could be used." 

popUp5="Note: The first taxable dollar is at the 35% marginal rate!"

popUp6="Note: The first taxable dollar is at the 35% marginal rate!"

popUp7="The Correct Credit Calculation"

popUp7+="\n\nThe Credit calculation uses the credit to offset the tax on the first $5,000,000, which includes the lower rates, leaving the balance of the estate to be taxed at the highest rate."

popUp8="The Correct Credit Calculation"
popUp8+="\n\nThe Credit calculation uses the credit to offset the tax on the first $5,120,000, which includes the lower rates, leaving the balance of the estate to be taxed at the highest rate." 
popUp8+="\n\nNote: The first taxable dollar is at the 35% marginal rate!"
