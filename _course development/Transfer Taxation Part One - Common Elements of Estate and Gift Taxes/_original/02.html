<p>For centuries, society has developed procedures for dealing with the transfer of assets at death. As far back as 2900 BC, records indicate the existence of a formal process of asset transfer. The ancient Romans also encouraged <em>testamentary</em> (at death) transfers of property so as to prevent widows and orphans from becoming burdens of the state.</p>
<p>Our own laws regarding testamentary passage of property stem from English common law, more specifically from the <strong><em>1540 Statute of Wills</em></strong> in England. This statute allowed all individuals, with the exception of married women, the insane, and infants, the right to dispose of property by a written will. While English law is the basis for most of our estate planning today, French and Spanish influences can also be found in those states with community property laws.</p>
<h3>The American Concept of an Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>While laws pertaining to the transfer of property have ancient roots, the placement of a tax upon the transfer of property is a relatively modern concept. The philosophy behind the concept in the United States goes back to Thomas Paine, who argued, in his highly influential publication, <strong><em>Common Sense</em></strong>, that <em>&ldquo;all hereditary government is in its nature tyranny.&rdquo;</em> As he put it, &ldquo;Hereditary succession&hellip; is in its nature an absurdity, because it is impossible to make wisdom hereditary&hellip; History informs us that the son of Solomon was a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subsequently, in <strong><em>The Rights of Man</em></strong> and <strong><em>Agrarian Justice</em></strong>, Paine expanded his critique of <em>inherited political power</em> to include a critique of <em>inherited economic power</em>. He advocated <strong><em>an inheritance tax</em></strong> that would be levied upon estates at death that would balance out the unfair distribution of property among the landed gentry. His proposal was for the tax to be used to provide every individual with 15 pounds sterling upon turning age 21 and to give 10 pounds sterling per year to individuals over the age 50.</p>
