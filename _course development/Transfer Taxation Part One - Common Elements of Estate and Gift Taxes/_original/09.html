<p>Every U.S. citizen and resident alien has a lifetime <strong><em>credit</em></strong> against gift and estate taxes; it is typically referred to as the &ldquo;<strong><em>Applicable Credit Amount</em></strong>.&rdquo; A &ldquo;credit&rdquo; is an amount that you get to <strong><em>subtract after a tax is calculated</em></strong>. So, once we calculate a tentative transfer tax, we get to subtract the credit from the calculated tax.</p>
<p>The Applicable Credit Amount is &ldquo;<strong><em>unified</em></strong>,&rdquo; meaning it is shared with lifetime transfers (i.e., gifts) and estate transfers (i.e., at death); for this reason, you will sometimes see the Applicable Credit Amount referred to as the &ldquo;<strong><em>Unified Credit</em></strong>.&rdquo; Thus, the credit can be used to offset calculated gift or estate taxes; but if it is all used up by lifetime taxable gifts, there will be no credit left to protect further assets that transfer at death.</p>
<p>Historically, the Applicable Credit Amount has not always been fully unified between gift and estate taxes. In other words, there have been times in the past when only a portion of the Applicable Credit Amount could be used for lifetime taxable gifts; but today, there is no limit on how much of the credit can be used while alive.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example. Suppose you wish to calculate the transfer tax on $120,000. Here is how you do it:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &ndash; Find the row where $120,000 is between the number in Column A and the number in Column B.&nbsp; As you can see, it is the 7th row, where the range between Column A and Column B is $100,000 to $150,000.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> &ndash; Identify the tax on the $100,000 amount given in Column A. This is provided in Column C, where we see that the tax on $100,000 is $23,800.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> &ndash; Now calculate the tax on the amount over $100,000 using the rate found in Column D. Since our amount is $20,000 over the $100,000 for which we have already been provided the tax amount, multiply $20,000 by 30% to get $6,000.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> &ndash; Add together the tax from Step 2 and Step 3. Thus, our tax on the first $100,000 plus the tax on the next $20,000 equals $23,800 + $6,000, for a total tax of $29,800.</p>
