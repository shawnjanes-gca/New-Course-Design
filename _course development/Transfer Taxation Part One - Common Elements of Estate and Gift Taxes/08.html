  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Why Unify the Gift and Estate Tax?</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>One of the goals in creating a unified gift and estate tax system was to ultimately have everyone make the same transfer tax calculation regardless of the timing of the transfers. Just how this is accomplished is illustrated in the following example.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>Mr. Jones' Story</h3>
    <p>Mr. Jones made  taxable gifts during his lifetime (after  1976) of $800,000. He died in 2016 with an estate valued at $6,200,000. How do  you take into account his lifetime gift in computing his estate tax?</p>
     <div id="p7SMLcontent_1" class="sml-content">
        <div id="p7SMLwrapper_1">
          <h3>Answer:</h3>
			<p>First, add together his lifetime taxable gifts (those made  after 1976) and his final estate value, deriving a total of $7 million. Then  compute the tax on $7 million, deriving his tentative estate tax.</p>
			<p>If he paid any prior tax on his lifetime gifts (a likelihood  if the bulk of his taxable gifts were made prior to 2002 when the cumulative amount  that could be gifted without paying a tax was less than the cumulative $800,000  he gifted), then give him a credit in that amount against his estate tax.</p>
			<p>The  result is that Mr. Jones' estate tax is calculated on $7,000,000, which is the  same amount he would have used if he had never made lifetime taxable gifts  (ignoring potential market value changes). This illustrates how two people with  the same size estate will ultimately make the same estate tax calculation, even  though one person made lifetime taxable gifts and the other did not. To be  sure, there may be value in getting assets out of your estate during life  because the appreciation on those assets will not be in your estate when you  die; but ignoring market value changes, the tax calculation itself will be the  same.</p>

  <p>The concept illustrated by the example above is very  important to remember. <strong><em>Lifetime taxable gifts (made after 1976) are  added back whenever a federal gift or estate tax return is filed.</em></strong> Thus,  the calculation is always a cumulative calculation of all taxable transfers  since 1976. A credit, which we will discuss later, is available against the  calculated tax. Furthermore, if any gift taxes were previously paid on lifetime  transfers, then credit against the current tax calculation will also be given  for prior taxes paid.</p>
