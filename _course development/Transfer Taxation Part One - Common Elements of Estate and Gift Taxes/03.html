    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Most Americans alive today have never lived in a time without transfer taxes. But transfer taxation in the United States is a fairly modern form of taxation, which developed in stages. Each stage was followed by a change in public behavior that led to Congress responding with the next stage of development. The presentation below will provide information on the progressive development of the transfer tax system. </p>

&lt;p&gt;In 1916, Congress approved the implementation of an estate tax as a &quot;temporary measure&quot; to raise revenue.&lt;/p&gt;">
      
      <area shape="rect" coords="327,125,485,186" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1: Public Response&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this &quot;temporary measure&quot; became more permanent, people began looking for ways to avoid the tax. The answer was simple enough: simply transfer assets before you die. If you did not own it when you died, then no tax was due.&lt;/p&gt;">
      
      <area shape="rect" coords="143,212,296,284" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 Gift Tax: Tax on Lifetime Transfers&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To curtail efforts to avoid taxation by making lifetime gifts, Congress enacted a gift tax in 1924. This gift tax co-existed with the estate tax. Two aspects of this arrangement are important for understanding the evolution into our current form of taxation: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tax rate on gifts was 25% lower than the rate for estates. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both taxes were independent of the other&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, each calculation took place with no consideration of the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;">
      
      <area shape="rect" coords="333,320,478,378" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: Public Response&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the gift tax was less, the public continued to have an incentive to explore ways to make lifetime transfers, particularly through trusts, and avoid the estate tax with its higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;">
      
      <area shape="rect" coords="145,405,297,479" href="#"  class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3 Unification of Gift and Estate Tax&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to do away with the preferential tax treatment of lifetime transfers, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 created the Unified Gift and Estate Tax. This &quot;unified&quot; approach continues to this day. Its features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single tax rate &lt;/strong&gt; that is used for calculating both gift and estate taxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consideration of lifetime transfers when computing the estate tax.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, lifetime gifts (after 1976) are added back into the estate when computing the estate tax. A credit is then given for any gift taxes that were paid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;">
     
      <area shape="rect" coords="332,516,477,567" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_6" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: Public Response&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way people had learned to avoid transfer taxes was to make transfers that skipped entire generations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example.  &lt;/strong&gt;Suppose you have three generations: Parent, Child, and Grandchild. Further suppose that your ultimate goal is to keep everything in the family and transfer assets to the grandchild. This could be accomplished in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer through the child.&lt;/strong&gt; Here, the Parent makes a transfer to the Child, who subsequently transfers assets to the original donor's Grandchild. This results in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;two taxable transfers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, one for each successive generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer directly to the grandchild.&lt;/strong&gt; Here, the Parent skips the next generation and transfers assets directly to the Grandchild. Only &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one taxable transfer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This skipping of generations became a popular approach to minimizing taxes, and trusts were particularly useful vehicles for accomplishing multigenerational transfers.&lt;/p&gt;">
     
      <area shape="rect" coords="149,591,298,666" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_7" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4: Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the attempts to avoid the tax by skipping generations, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 also introduced a generation-skipping tax that severely curtailed the ability to skip generations without paying a tax. This tax, when applicable, is in addition to any gift or estate tax that may be applied.&lt;/p&gt;">
      
      <area shape="rect" coords="333,698,481,765" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_8" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4: Public Response&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the boom of the 1990's, there was increased political pressure to raise the amount of an estate that could be transferred free of taxes, with many politicians pushing for the total elimination of the estate tax.&lt;/p&gt;">
      
      <area shape="rect" coords="136,785,297,856" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_9" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 5 Expanded Exclusions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year following the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the tax rate schedule that was used to calculate the gift and estate tax went as high as 70% on amounts over $5,000,000. However, a tax credit was available to protect the first $120,000 of taxable transfers from actually having to pay a tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With continued political pressure and numerous tax acts later, the tax rate schedule that is currently used to calculate the tax has a maximum rate of 40% on amounts over $1,000,000. Furthermore, for 2016, the available lifetime credit to each person protects the first $5,450,000 (indexed for inflation). This represents a significant rate reduction and a significant expansion of the credit to offset the gift and estate tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will have more to say about the current tax environment on the following pages.&lt;/p&gt;">
