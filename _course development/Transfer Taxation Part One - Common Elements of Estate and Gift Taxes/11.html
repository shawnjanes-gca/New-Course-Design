  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Gift and Estate Tax Deductions: Charitable and Unlimited Marital</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Unlike the applicable credit amount, which is applied after  the tentative tax on the gift or estate is calculated, there are certain  deductions that actually reduce the taxable amount of the gift or estate <strong><em>before</em></strong> the tentative tax is calculated. Two important deductions that are available  for both gift and estate taxes are: </p>
  <ol start="1" type="1" style="width:95%;">
    <li><span><strong>Charitable Deductions</strong> – Transfers to qualified charities, during one's lifetime or at death receive an offsetting deduction, which removes them from computation of the transfer tax.</span> </li>
    <li><span><strong>The Unlimited Marital Deduction</strong> – Transfers of assets to U.S. citizen spouses are       non-taxable events regarding gift and estate taxes due to a "marital deduction" that is provided on the gift or estate tax form. This marital deduction is <em>unlimited</em>, so any amount can be transferred to U.S. citizen spouses during life or at death without triggering a gift or estate tax.
  <p>Beware, however, that there is no  "unlimited marital deduction" for transfers to spouses who are not U.S.  citizens, whether they are resident or nonresident in the United States.  Special rules apply and additional planning may be needed to minimize taxes on  transfers to a non-citizen spouse.</p>
   <p> On the following page, we will take  a deeper look at the unlimited marital deduction.</p></span></li>
