<p><strong>2. Dependent Children</strong></p>
<p>Dependent children will be listed on line 6c. Since most people are interested in talking about their children, it provides a great opportunity to ask some open-ended questions about the children, their ages, and their activities. This discussion will give you a better feel for the lifestyle your client leads and may reveal day-to-day situations for which the client needs assistance. Potential needs to explore include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Educational savings </em></strong>for clients with younger children. If there is a former marriage, are there binding obligations regarding the child's care and education? If the children are approaching or are at college age, what are their plans to cover these expenses? Have they utilized ESA or 529 plans? Do they have "Kiddie Tax" issues?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>General banking services for older children</em></strong>, such as checking accounts, credit cards, and even mortgages and investment management accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the child have any <strong><em>special care needs</em></strong>? This can be a very significant family, financial and emotional issue that they will often be very willing to talk about. You will want to know the extent of past, present and potential future financial obligations. What financial and support resources are available, and which have they utilized? Are your clients managing their situation or are they just reacting to it? Keep in mind that this may be a financial obligation for the rest of the parents' lives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Parents with special needs children will often be quite knowledgeable about financial issues regarding special needs children and will usually be members of a variety of special needs support groups. Make sure that they are connected to a special needs attorney to assist them in public assistance, legal, tax and estate planning issues. Substantial estate planning needs will exist and probably abnormally high life insurance needs. Note that as a Financial Professional, there is opportunity here to develop special expertise for these parents who invariably know many other parents in similar, specialized circumstances. Certain Financial Professionals would do well to develop some understanding of the issues involving special needs children and develop a network of other professionals with specialized experience in this area.</p>

<p><strong>3. Dependent Parents</strong></p>
<p>If a dependent is a parent, there are other issues the client may be facing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To what degree is and will the parent be financially dependent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there significant current or future medical expenses that are of a concern to the client? How will these expenses be covered? Is there potential for Medigap and/or Long-Term Care Insurance?</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Will an Assisted Care Facility, Continuing Care Retirement Community or Nursing Home need to be considered in the future?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a need for estate planning or elder care expertise? Are will(s) up-to-date? Is a living trust in order? Has the parent(s) executed a Health Care Proxy and Durable Power of Attorney?

<p><strong>4. Other Dependents </strong></p>
<p>If children have different last names than parents, there may be a remarriage with possible financial obligations or implications. Sometimes, the dependent named on the return may not be a member of the immediate family. For example, the dependent may be a grandchild or a niece or nephew. The specific situation will dictate what other questions are asked. If possible, helpful information to obtain includes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Is the dependent related to the client? If so, what is the relationship?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the inclusion of this individual in the household a permanent situation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the age of the dependent and what special considerations are there? Take care in this area, as it, too, can raise some uncomfortable feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>What current and potential financial obligations does your client have for this dependent?</li>
