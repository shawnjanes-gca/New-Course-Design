  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Two-Year Comparison</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Thus far, we have discussed the examination of a single tax  return.  However, many tax preparers and  software packages offer a <strong><em>2-year comparison</em></strong> along with the tax  return.  If this comparison is included  with the tax information you are reviewing, take note of any changes from the  prior year to the current year:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Has there been a change in the number of dependents?  </li>
    <li>Has there been a significant change in income or deduction amounts?  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These changes reflected in the tax data can mirror changes in  the client's life situation.  Children  may be moving out of the house, creating a situation where the client may be  looking to downsize their home or add a vacation home.  The client may have also added a dependent,  indicating a birth or financial responsibility for a dependent.  This may indicate the need for additional  cash flow.</p>
