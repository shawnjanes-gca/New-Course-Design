  <p>The IRS requires all taxes to be paid evenly or ratably throughout the year.  If the client does not have a withholding mechanism that will satisfy this even payment requirement, that client will be required to make quarterly estimated tax payments.  You can discover which method is being utilized by the client, and the size of those payments, by looking at the following lines (below).</p>

  <p>If the client is making estimated payments, these payments should be considered when cash flow is discussed, as many clients discount this requirement.  To assist in this matter, you might be able to offer a line of credit or might propose the laddering of bonds with maturity dates in line with the payments so as to avoid selling securities to make the tax payments.</p>
