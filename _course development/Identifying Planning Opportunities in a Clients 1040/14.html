    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Unlike  individuals in the U.S., not all deductions are created equal.  Some provide much more benefit than  others.  The Internal Revenue Code  divides deductions into two categories: those "above the line" and those "below  the line."  "The line" is a magic number  called <strong><em>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)</em></strong> and it appears twice on the tax return.  It is the last number on the first page and  the first number on the last page.   Adjusted Gross Income is used throughout the return to calculate the  deductibility of expenses, the deductibility of exemptions, the calculation of  tax and the application of tax credits.   Generally speaking, deductions "above the line" provide more benefit  than those "below the line" due to the importance of the AGI number. </p>
  <p>What are "above the line" deductions?  They are the deductions that are taken to  transform Gross Income into Adjusted Gross Income.  The three primary deductions of importance to  us are those allowed for: (1) IRA and other retirement plan contributions; (2)  self-employed health insurance payments; and (3) education expenses.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each numbered area to learn more.</span></p>

&lt;p&gt;With regard to retirement plan contributions, the client is using cash to save for retirement.   You should ask about the client’s plans for retirement, timing for retirement and the need for additional savings.  If the plan includes an IRA, is the client happy with the current provider?  Has the asset allocation been properly adhered to in light of the stated goals?  Would a rollover be appropriate to meet the client’s goals? &lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;Self-employed health insurance payments indicate the client is a business owner.  This information should be included with other information on the return regarding the business, and is useful in discussing other business-related insurance needs such as life insurance and umbrella liability coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of an Archer Savings Account indicates a tax-savvy client and offers the opportunity to ask about the current custodial services and ensure the client's needs are being met.&lt;/p&gt;">

&lt;p&gt;A deduction for education expenses indicates that someone in the household is engaged in higher learning.  Who is that person?  Is a dependent, the client, or a spouse in school?  Is additional funding needed for education expenses?  You should discuss the various lending products that might fill a cash flow need for the client.  The presence of education expenses can also lead into a discussion of future cash flow needs and plans for career changes. &lt;/p&gt;" >
