<p>What are "below the line" deductions? These are deductions most commonly referred to as itemized deductions, by which AGI is adjusted to derive taxable income. These deductions are made up of medical expenses, taxes, interest, charitable contributions, casualty losses and miscellaneous deductions. While itemized deductions are reported on a single line of the return, the details behind the deductions are shown on <strong>Schedule A</strong>, which shall be examined more closely below.</p>

<p><strong>1. Medical Expenses</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to receive a tax benefit from medical expenses due to a "floor" (costs that exceed 10% of the taxpayer's AGI) that the IRS requires before the taxpayer can deduct any of these expenses. Unless the client is paying for nursing home expenses or has experienced a catastrophic medical event, most taxpayers are unable to gain benefit from medical expenses.</p>
<p>Thus, an entry in this area indicates long-term medical care costs or a one-time event. Inquiry should be made to identify any possible implications regarding estate planning needs.</p>

<p><strong>2. Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Yes, taxes are deductible. Which ones? State income tax payments, real estate taxes, and personal property taxes are most common in this area. You can learn several things from this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can identify the person's home state based on the state income tax payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The payment of real estate taxes indicates a possible mortgage opportunity. In fact, further discussion about what type of property is generating the real estate taxes could reveal multiple properties, such as a main home and a vacation property, all mortgage opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The presence of state income taxes serves as a reminder to consider both Federal and State taxes when examining the tax effectiveness of investments.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>3. Interest Expense</strong></p>
<p>The presence of interest expense should always lead to a discussion of mortgage products. In doing so, you should be mindful of the use of the proceeds and the ability to deduct the interest expense. Even though mortgage interest is reported on a tax return, it doesn't mean it is always deductible. The general rules for deducting interest expense take into consideration the purpose of the loan. If the proceeds of the loan are used for personal expenses, the interest is generally not deductible. The exception to the rule is a mortgage on the main home. If the main home secures the loan, then the interest is deductible. Most people think of the exception as the general rule because they have a mortgage on their home. For details regarding the deductibility of mortgage interest, refer your client to a qualified tax advisor.</p>
<p>Investment interest is also reported in this section. This can lead to inquiries regarding the nature of the debt(s), the size of the debts relative to the collateral assets, the cash flow requirements, and possible restructuring of the debt.</p>

<p><strong>4. Charitable Contributions</strong></p>
<p>Charitable contributions indicate the client's philanthropic intentions. Large deductions could lead to a discussion of the benefits of a charitable trust, a private foundation, or a community foundation as alternatives to outright gifting. Also of importance is the nature of the property being contributed.</p>
<p>A number of fact-finding questions are appropriate regarding this matter, some of which you can discern without even asking the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is cash being used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there other assets that would serve this purpose better?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the client contribute more than was deductible in one year and is there a carry-forward of the benefit?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the client realize when the deduction provides benefits?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the client's long-term intentions for charitable contributions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are those intentions reflected in the client's day-to-day activities, in the portfolio of investments, and in the estate plan?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By gathering this information, you can use this topic to open a discussion regarding the next generation of a wealthy client. For example, you might ask an open-ended question like, "How do you balance your desire to make charitable contributions against your desire to leave behind an estate for your family?" The client might be surprised to find that there are techniques available to maximize the lifetime benefit of making gifts to charities (e.g., gifting appreciated property, charitable remainder trusts, etc.), while also preserving the estate for loved ones (e.g., using the proceeds from a charitable remainder trust to purchase life insurance). You should be prepared to discuss these options with the client. There are many planning opportunities for charitable contributions and the Advisor should discuss these options with the client.</p>

<p><strong>5. Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions</strong></p>
<p>Last are miscellaneous itemized deductions. The tax preparation fee and investment/trust fees are reported here. The consultant can get an idea of what the competition is billing for investment management and for trust services. You should discern the answer to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What do you value in your relationship with these advisors?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What changes would you make in these relationships?</p>
