  <p>In your day-to-day business, you routinely have the opportunity to see a client or prospect's individual income tax return – sometimes in the estate planning process, or the credit application process, or in association with a trust account.  When you get the chance to see these returns, what information about your client can you glean from them in a fairly short amount of time without becoming a CPA or earning a Master's Degree in Tax?  Having gleaned that information, how can you use it to identify potential needs and solutions for your client?  These are the questions that are answered by this course.</p>
