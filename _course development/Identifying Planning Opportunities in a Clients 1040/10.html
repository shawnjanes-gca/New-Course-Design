  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Here's an opportunity to showcase your investment and tax expertise. Effective for 2013 and later tax years, a 3.8% tax is assessed against certain unearned income. The purpose of the tax is to provide additional funding to Medicare. Because this tax is commonly misunderstood, we present a detailed review along with suggestions for client dialogue.</p>
  <p>This tax is payable on the lesser of net investment income or adjusted gross income over the following thresholds. </p>

<p>The calculation of this tax is best illustrated by example. Assume that your clients are married and file jointly. Their adjusted gross income is $400,000.  Their investment income is $210,000 and they have $10,000 in investment expenses. Their net investment income tax is $5,700 calculated as follows.</p>

<p>The NIIT is assessed on <a href="greene\Identifying_planning_opportunities_client_1040\pdfs\Form_8960_2015.pdf" target="_blank">IRS Form 8960</a>. </p>

<p>In reviewing this form, you should be focused upon helping your client understand how portfolio investment decisions affect the NIIT.</p>
<div class="example-box">
	<h3>Effective Question</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>How has your advisor minimized this tax in your investment strategy? </li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<p>This question should lead to a dialogue around alternatives for avoiding or minimizing the tax. <span class="pageInstruction">Click <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding or Minimizing the NIIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tax counsel or the client's CPA should be involved in long-term  tax planning; however, you should know there are two broad approaches in managing  the NIIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restructure your client's portfolio to avoid the NIIT

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider the purchase of municipal bonds because  the municipal bond interest income is not subject to the NIIT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only recognized capital gains are subject to the  NIIT; hence, a &quot;buy and hold&quot; investment strategy, if appropriate for your  client's investment goals, will reduce the net investment income subject to the  NIIT. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charitably-inclined clients should consider gifting appreciated securities instead of cash. The gains will not be reported  as investment income and your client receives an income tax deduction (generally) for the fair market value of the appreciated security. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harvest capital losses, where appropriate, to offset capital gains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income from Subchapter S Corporations or  Partnerships in which your client is inactive in the business is called passive  income. Passive income is &quot;investment income&quot; for purposes of the NIIT.  If appropriate, your client may wish to  become active in the business to avoid the passive income. Your client should  discuss this with their CPA or tax professional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Minimize your client's AGI

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Qualifying distributions from ROTH IRA, Roth  401(k), Roth 403(b), and Roth 457(b) accounts are income tax-free and NIIT-free.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distributions from Traditional IRAs and most qualified retirement plans are not &quot;investment income&quot; for NIIT purposes, but  these taxable distributions increase AGI. Increases to AGI above the thresholds  listed above can expose your client to the NIIT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While beyond the scope for  this course, the sale of a business or investment property can incur the NIIT. In these cases, tax-deferred exchanges and/or installment sales may be considered where otherwise appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1" >here</a> to learn more.</span></p>
