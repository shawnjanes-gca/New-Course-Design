  <p>The business income detail can be found on Schedule C, a copy of which can be viewed by clicking <a href="greene\Identifying_planning_opportunities_client_1040\pdfs\2015_Schedule_C_Form_1040.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
 
<p>For our purposes, do not be overly concerned with understanding everything you see on Schedule C.  Think of it is a place where you can identify what the client is interested in or what the client is familiar with.  People generally like to talk about themselves, particularly if they enjoy their profession.  These discussions can help create a common ground between you and the client. </p>
<p>As you review the schedule, here are some questions to keep in mind. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each question to see the answer.</span></p>

    <h3>How aggressive is the person with deducting expenses? </h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Take a closer look at the expenses in Part II of the Schedule.  In particular, look at the ratio of expenses to income.  Some business owners can be extremely aggressive in finding expenses that can be deducted.  If this ratio is high, then you can be pretty sure that the client will be equally aggressive regarding investments.</p>

    <h3>Are there estate planning needs?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Small businesses generally present important estate planning considerations, such as:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Has the client thought about an exit plan for the business?</li>  
		<li>Is there a succession plan that involves a child or a partner? </li>
     </ul> 
	<p>Are there life and health insurance needs related to the business? </p>
