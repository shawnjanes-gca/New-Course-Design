  <p>The "regular" tax responsibility, along with extra taxes, is calculated in the last section of the tax return.  There are some key issues to note in this section.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each numbered area to learn more.</span></p>

      <area shape="rect" coords="8,148,798,168" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - Regular Tax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“regular tax”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the tax that most people think of.  It is calculated based on income less deductions and exemptions. &lt;/p&gt;
">
      <area shape="rect" coords="7,169,800,185" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another extra tax is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternative Minimum Tax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This tax is a misunderstood tax.  It is calculated for every person filing a tax return for every year that a return is filed.  Many people are unaware of this tax because it is a minimum tax, and their calculated “regular” income tax is above this minimum tax.  However, once a client deducts enough expenses to cause the “regular” tax to be calculated below the minimum tax number, that client will become painfully aware of AMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see an entry on this line, then you should look for Form 6251, which will be part of the return.  There are several items you should explore on that form, which will be discussed on the next page.&lt;/p&gt;">
      <area shape="rect" coords="0,216,800,335" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 - Tax Credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign tax credits, child tax credits, dependent care credit, and education credits are the most common credits reported in this section.  For our purposes here, you are most concerned with the presence of a foreign tax credit on Line 44.  This is an indicator that there are international investments in the client's portfolio.  This provides additional information to help you flesh out a picture of the client's current investments.    &lt;/p&gt;

      <area shape="rect" coords="2,368,799,483" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 - Extra Taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra taxes are calculated based on extra items such as business income (self-employment tax) and whether or not the client employs workers like a housekeeper or a nanny.  This is simply supplemental information that may be useful to know when discussing the client's current needs. The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) is reported in this section. Please refer to our earlier discussion of uncovering client needs in connection with the NIIT.&lt;/p&gt;
