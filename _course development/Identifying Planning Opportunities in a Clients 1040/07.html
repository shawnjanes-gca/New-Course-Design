  <p>Based on the information you gather on the interest and dividend section of the tax return, it is possible to identify a preliminary asset allocation.  For example, on the previous page we provide illustrations for bonds and stocks that would provide the preliminary asset allocation (below).</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Taxable Bonds</th>
      <td>$466,667</td>
      <td>39%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Tax-free Bonds</th>
      <td>$125,000</td>
      <td>11%</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <th scope="row">Stocks</th>
      <td>$600,000</td>
      <td>50%</td>
    </tr>

  <p>As we continue through the return, we will point out other sections of the return that will provide additional information regarding investments.</p>
  <p>Altogether, this investment information will provide you with sufficient information to initiate an informed investment discussion with the client.  During the course of that discussion, you can ask fact-finding questions that will clarify your understanding and help you determine potential needs.  You will also have opportunities to ask open-ended questions that help increase awareness about his or her current situation, thereby helping the client see the shortcomings that you find in the current portfolio and foster interest in solutions you can offer.</p>
  <p>Here are some key questions to consider asking.  Note that we have deliberately positioned some of these questions to place responsibility on the current advisor, rather than running the risk of embarrassing the client. Click each question to see the answer.</p>

      <p><strong>Answer:  </strong>This question opens up a general  discussion of the investment portfolio, allowing you to gain insight into the  client's needs, objectives, and concerns, while also allowing you to ask  further fact-finding questions like:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>What are your short-term and long-term financial needs?</li>
        <li>How much income must your investments generate to meet your current needs?</li>
        <li>What are some of the specific holdings in your portfolio?</li>
        <li>How were these investments selected?</li>
        <li>How concerned would you be if the market value of your investments declined 10% over the course of a       year?  20%? 30%?</li>
        <li>How satisfied are you with your current investment advisor? How do you make that assessment?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This discussion will generally shed light on whether or not the invested assets are properly allocated, adequately diversified, and at the proper level of risk.  As these  situations present themselves, you can further develop the conversation by  asking some questions that increase awareness such as:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>How has your advisor worked with you to establish clearly-defined investment objectives?</li>
        <li>How has your advisor worked with you to select investments that are appropriate for your       objectives?</li>
      </ul>
		<p>Such awareness questions  will help the client recognize a need and incline the client to be receptive to  the solutions you deem appropriate.</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:  </strong>As you learn more about the client's needs and objectives, it may become apparent that the asset allocation is inappropriate. This is an excellent awareness question by which you can introduce a discussion regarding asset allocation.</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:  </strong>Municipal bonds generally yield an interest rate below corporate bond  rates.  Yet, due to the tax-free nature  of many of these bonds, tax savings can at times more than compensate for the  lost yield.  If a client is in a lower  tax bracket, but holding municipal bonds, then the client is not being  adequately compensated for the lower yield. Similarly, if a client is in a higher tax bracket, but holding taxable  bonds, then the client's after-tax income can be increased through a shift to  municipal bonds.</p>
<p>To identify what is appropriate for your client, you need to  know the client's marginal tax rate.   This can be found by looking at the back of Form 1040 to find the  client's taxable income and then locating that income on a tax rate  schedule.  </p>
    <p><strong>Example</strong> - Upon examining the 2016 return of a married couple filing jointly, you learn that the taxable income is $250,000. Locating this  income on the following rate table reveals that the federal marginal bracket is 33%.</p>
    <table id="tableAlignLeft">
     
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col"><strong>If Taxable Income Is:</strong></th>
          <th scope="col"><strong>If Taxable Income Is:</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tr>       
        <td>Not over $18,550</td>
        <td>10% of the taxable income</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Over $18,550 but not over $75,300</td>
        <td>$1,855 plus $15% of the excess over $18,550</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Over $75,300 but not over $151,900</td>
        <td>$10,367.50 plus 25% of the excess over $75,300</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Over $151,900 but not over $231,450</td>
        <td>$29,517.50 plus 28% of the excess over $151,900</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Over $231,450 but not over $413,350</td>
        <td>$51,791.50 plus 33% of the excess over $231,450</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Over $413,350 but not over $466,950</td>
        <td>$111,818.50 plus 35% of the excess over $413,350</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      	<td>Over $466,950</td>
        <td>$130,578.50 plus 39.6% of the excess over $466,950</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>By analyzing the after-tax return of taxable and tax-free investments at a 33% marginal bracket, you can make the determination as to whether a shift in the bond portfolio is appropriate and whether or not this awareness question should be asked.</p>
