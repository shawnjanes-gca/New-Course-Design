<p>These plans define the benefits (fixed monthly payments) received by employees at retirement. The amount of the payment is typically a function of an employee&rsquo;s years of employment and compensation level while employed. As shown in the illustration below, there are three types of Defined Benefit Plans (often referred to as &ldquo;DB Plans&rdquo;). </p>

              <p>Here is an often-overlooked opportunity. While these plans are viewed as the sole province of only the largest, most financially sound employers, there is a potential need on the other end of the spectrum. A small business owner/employee may find the Traditional DB Plan an impactful strategy to fund a retirement plan with tax-deductible contributions. Especially for the owner/employee beginning to save for retirement late in life, a Traditional DB Plan may offer much higher tax-deductible contribution limits vs. a Defined Contribution Category Plan. There is an ominous caveat, however. Because federal law requires broad employee participation in most qualified plans, the small business owner will need to analyze the cost of including other employees in the plan.</p>
              <p>Plan participants may treasure Traditional DB Plans while large employers may rightly fear these plans. The plan participant receives a guaranteed income for life at retirement that may even be adjusted annually for inflation in some plans. Plan sponsors bear enormous investment risk. How big is enormous? General Motors at one time had a $10B (that&rsquo;s B as in billion) unfunded liability to its defined benefit plan due in part to subpar investment performance.</p>
              <p>The amount of the employee&rsquo;s retirement income payment is typically a function of an employee's years of employment and compensation level while employed. The benefit can be reasonably estimated in advance and the maximum benefit is subject to statutory <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;The maximum annual benefit that can be funded for a benefit beginning at age 65 (in 2016, as indexed) is the lesser of $210,000 or 100% of the average compensation earned over the three highest paid consecutive years. These limits are referred to as the &ldquo;Section 415(b)&rdquo; limits. The limits are lower for retirement before age 62 and higher for retirement after age 65.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">limits</a>. The funding of the plan is usually the sole responsibility of the employer; however, a variation of the plan - the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, plan participants may make salary deferrals into a specialized version of the Traditional Defined Benefit Plan known as the DB(k) Plan. The employer is allowed, but not required to, make DB(k) Plans available. DB(k) Plans are designed to require less sponsor cost vs. traditional DB Plans to encourage adoption by small to medium-sized business owners.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">DB(k) Plan</a> - allows participant deferrals.</p>

              <p>As in any qualified plan, taxation of withdrawals from the plan is deferred until withdrawn by the plan participant. Employers are subject to at least a quarterly funding obligation, regardless of the company&rsquo;s profitability.</p>
              <p>The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), in its August 2011 Notes, Vol. 32, No. 8, reports a free fall in employee participation rates in private sector Defined Benefits Plans. In 1979, 38% of private sector employees participated in these plans and by 2008, the participation rate had plummeted to 15%. This plummet can be attributed to the increasing lack of such plan offerings by employers. By 2011, only 1 in 10 private sector employers offered a Defined Benefit Plan.<sup>1</sup></p>
              <p>Here is a key takeaway. A client currently participating in a Defined Benefit Plan should carefully consider the retirement accumulation impact of changing jobs if the new employer does not offer a DB Plan.</p>

              <p>A Fully Insured Defined Benefit Plan is simply a Traditional DB Plan funded exclusively with life insurance and/or annuity products. Employers are attracted to fully insured plans because investment risk is shifted from the plan sponsor to an insurance company, costs of plan set-up and administration are less than a Traditional DB Plan, and the contribution levels are typically higher in the early plan years than in a Traditional DB Plan. For those reasons, the Fully Insured DB Plan may also appeal to the small business owner/employee.</p>

              <p>Cash Balance Pension Plans are functionally a hybrid of defined benefit plans and defined contribution category plans. The employer makes contributions to the plan based on actuarial calculations (like a DB Plan). Each employee&rsquo;s non-segregated account accumulates based on contributions and interest &ldquo;credits.&rdquo; Like a defined contribution category plan, these plans pay out benefits at retirement based on how much money has accumulated in the account. Typically, the employer guarantees the interest rate (which is usually modest due to short-term rate assumptions and guarantees).</p>
              <p>Cash Balance Plans have been the subject of controversy in recent years since many large companies have amended their Defined Benefit Plans to Cash Balance Plans. These amendments tend to significantly reduce future benefit accruals for older/shorter-term employees. Why the change? Cash Balance Plans are much less expensive to administer and pose far less investment risk to the employer. Annual employer contributions are required.</p>
