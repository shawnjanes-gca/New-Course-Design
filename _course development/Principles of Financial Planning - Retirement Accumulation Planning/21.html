  <p>Contributions to a Traditional IRA are generally, but not always, deductible on an individual&rsquo;s income tax return. The tax deductibility of those contributions is phased out if the individual meets <strong><em>two</em></strong> conditions:</p>
  <p>1.	The individual is an active participant in an <a href="#"><span id="p7Tooltip_1" class="p7TTM_trg" title="<p>This category includes all of the qualified plans - SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and 403(b) Plans. We will analyze these plans subsequently in this course.</p>">employer-sponsored retirement plan</span></a></p>
  <p><strong>AND</strong></p>
  <p>2. The individual&rsquo;s Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) exceeds specified phase-out limits (described on the next page).</p>
  <div id="p7SMLcontent_1" class="sml-content">

<p>Many of your clients will participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan. You need to understand when they can and cannot deduct contributions to a Traditional IRA. Why? If they cannot deduct their Traditional IRA contribution, a Roth IRA may be a better financial choice! For those reasons, the following detailed review is presented.</p>
  <p>The phase-out begins and ends with the following amounts of modified AGI, depending upon the filing status and whether or not both spouses actively participate in an employer-sponsored plan (remember, if a single taxpayer or both spouses (Married Filing Jointly) are NOT participants in an employer-sponsored plan, they can deduct their Traditional IRA contributions regardless of how high their income might be): <span class="pageInstruction">Click on the 2016 Single or HOH Filer number in chart to learn more.</span></p>
