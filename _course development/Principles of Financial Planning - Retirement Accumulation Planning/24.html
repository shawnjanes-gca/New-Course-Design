  <!-- pagetitle --></h1><h3>Rollovers</h3></p>
  <p>The term &ldquo;IRA Rollover&rdquo; describes the process by which an individual receives a distribution from his or her IRA and then rolls over or re-deposits the total amount of the distribution into a different IRA (or qualified plan) within 60 days. A rollover occurs whenever the individual has complete control over the funds for a period of time. A rollover completed within 60 days is considered a timely rollover. Timely rollovers do not result in penalty or income tax. Effective for 2016, only one IRA rollover per taxpayer per year is permitted with certain exceptions.</p>

  <p>Rollovers are not limited to only IRA-to-IRA rollovers. Certain qualified plan accounts can  roll over into an IRA and certain IRAs may generally be rolled over into a qualified plan - these rollovers are not subject to the one rollover per taxpayer per year rule.</p>
  <p>There will generally be no income tax consequence resulting from a rollover as long as pretax funds are rolled over timely into pretax accounts or Roth funds are rolled over timely into Roth accounts. The chart below illustrates selected income tax-free rollover opportunities between IRAs and qualified plans.</p>
  <p>A complete list of permitted rollovers is available from the IRS at the following link:   <u>http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf</u></p>

  <p>Rollovers may be subject to withholding taxes. Rollovers from an IRA are technically subject to a 10% withholding; however, the IRA owner may elect out of withholding. In contrast, rollovers from a qualified plan are subject to a mandatory 20% withholding. This is a trap for the unwary! Your client must re-deposit 100% of the rollover funds within 60 days to avoid penalty. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here for an example.</span></p>

  <!-- Planning Tip --><h3>Direct Transfers</h3>
  <p>In stark contrast to the rollover, the qualified plan participant or IRA owner never has control of a direct transfer. Literally, the funds are transferred directly from one custodian or trustee to another custodian or trustee. The IRA owner or qualified plan participant is not permitted to control or access the funds at any time during the transfer. </p>
  <p>Direct transfers may also be referred to as &ldquo;direct trustee-to-trustee&rdquo; transfers or &ldquo;direct custodian-to-custodian&rdquo; transfers. Unlike rollovers, there is no income tax withheld in a direct transfer from a qualified plan and there is no IRS limit to the number of direct transfers a client may execute per year. No income tax is due as a result of a direct transfer.</p></div>
