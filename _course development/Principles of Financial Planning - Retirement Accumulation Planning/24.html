  <!-- pagetitle --></h1><h3>Rollovers</h3></p>
  <p>The term &ldquo;IRA Rollover&rdquo; describes the process by which an individual receives a distribution from his or her IRA and then rolls over or re-deposits the total amount of the distribution into a different IRA (or qualified plan) within 60 days. A rollover occurs whenever the individual has complete control over the funds for a period of time. A rollover completed within 60 days is considered a timely rollover. Timely rollovers do not result in penalty or income tax. Effective for 2016, only one IRA rollover per taxpayer per year is permitted with certain <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;An unlimited number of trustee-to-trustee IRA transfers and Traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions is permitted.  Trustee-to-trustee transfers are not technically rollovers.  Traditional IRA conversion to a Roth IRA results in taxable income in the conversion year and hence, additional tax dollars paid to the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">exceptions</a>.</p>

  <p>Rollovers are not limited to only IRA-to-IRA rollovers. Certain qualified plan accounts can  roll over into an IRA and certain IRAs may generally be rolled over into a qualified plan - these rollovers are not subject to the one rollover per taxpayer per year rule.</p>
  <p>There will generally be no income tax consequence resulting from a rollover as long as pretax funds are rolled over timely into pretax accounts or Roth funds are rolled over timely into Roth accounts. The chart below illustrates selected income tax-free rollover opportunities between IRAs and qualified plans.</p>
  <p>A complete list of permitted rollovers is available from the IRS at the following link:   <u>http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf</u></p>

  <p>Rollovers may be subject to withholding taxes. Rollovers from an IRA are technically subject to a 10% withholding; however, the IRA owner may elect out of withholding. In contrast, rollovers from a qualified plan are subject to a mandatory 20% withholding. This is a trap for the unwary! Your client must re-deposit 100% of the rollover funds within 60 days to avoid penalty. <span class="pageInstruction">Click <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% Withholding Trap Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Robert &ldquo;Hasty&rdquo; Smith is your client. Hasty executed a withdrawal from his qualified plan of $100,000 and the plan administrator withheld a mandatory $20,000 for estimated income taxes. Hasty received an $80,000 check payable to &ldquo;Robert Smith.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hasty must deposit $100,000 into his IRA within 60 days to avoid penalty. However, let us assume that he only deposited $80,000 into his IRA within the 60-day window. Hasty must pay a $2,000 penalty (10% of $20,000) because his rollover was $20,000 short.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happens when he files his income tax return? The $20,000 withheld from his qualified plan distribution will be counted as a payment of his income taxes and may result in a refund. The $2,000 penalty is neither deductible nor refundable.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">here</a> for an example.</span></p>

  <!-- Planning Tip --><h3>Direct Transfers</h3>
  <p>In stark contrast to the rollover, the qualified plan participant or IRA owner never has control of a direct transfer. Literally, the funds are transferred directly from one custodian or trustee to another custodian or trustee. The IRA owner or qualified plan participant is not permitted to control or access the funds at any time during the transfer. </p>
  <p>Direct transfers may also be referred to as &ldquo;direct trustee-to-trustee&rdquo; transfers or &ldquo;direct custodian-to-custodian&rdquo; transfers. Unlike rollovers, there is no income tax withheld in a direct transfer from a qualified plan and there is no IRS limit to the number of direct transfers a client may execute per year. No income tax is due as a result of a direct transfer.</p></div>
