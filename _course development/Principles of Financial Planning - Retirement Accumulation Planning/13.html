  <p>More than 25% of all retirement assets in the United States are held in IRAs. Almost $1.5 trillion in assets are owned in IRA form, based upon data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute®.<sup>1</sup></p>
  <p>Without doubt, one of the most important retirement savings vehicles to understand for purposes of advising affluent clients is the IRA. Below are reasons why understanding an IRA is important:</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
    <ul>
      <li>These arrangements are the most likely ones to be implemented by individuals, partners, or small businesses. Therefore, they are the ones in which your affluent clients are most likely to be involved and over which they have the most control. </li>
      <li>The investment decisions of IRAs are <strong><em>entirely</em></strong> at the discretion of the individual owner. Therefore, this type of retirement arrangement offers significant opportunity for providing investment services to affluent clients.  </li>
      <li>The individual owner manages funding and distributions. Since there is no corporate plan administrator who can answer questions, as with many qualified plans, clients are likely to look to you and your organization for help in getting answers to their questions.</li>
      <li>Employees often rollover assets from employer-sponsored retirement plans into an IRA when they change employers or retire.</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
<p>For these reasons, in examining retirement plans/arrangements, we will give primary focus to understanding IRAs.</p>
<p>While this course will not make you an expert on IRAs and you will certainly want to call upon IRA experts within your own organization for many client inquiries, it <em>will</em> give you familiarity with the most frequently asked questions associated with IRAs and equip you to dialog effectively with affluent clients.</p>
