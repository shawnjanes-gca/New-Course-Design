<p>Personal Savings include all taxable savings vehicles, such as individual brokerage accounts and bank savings accounts. These accounts are not uniquely designed for retirement saving and typically offer no tax-deferral benefits. Therefore, they should generally be used as a secondary retirement savings vehicle, after the use of other more &ldquo;tax-advantaged&rdquo; vehicles has been exhausted.</p>
<p>However, there is at least one circumstance in which personal savings may be appropriate. A client wishing to invest in growth securities to achieve long-term capital gains income tax rates may find it beneficial to use personal savings as an investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Why? Earnings from tax-deferred accounts, such as employer-sponsored retirement plans and Traditional IRAs are generally taxed as ordinary income when distributed. Long-term gain from personally owned accounts would be taxed at preferential long-term capital gain rates if holding period requirements are met.</p>
<p>The top ordinary income tax rate is 39.6% (2016) while the top capital gains rate is 20% (2016). If your client can shift gain from ordinary income to capital gains, an income tax savings of approximately 20%<sup>1</sup> (19.6%) may be achieved.</p>
Hence, investments that produce ordinary income should generally be owned in IRA or employer-sponsored retirement &nbsp;plan form while it may be appropriate to earmark at least a portion of your client&rsquo;s growth securities into an individual brokerage account.
<p style="font-size: 10px;"><em><sup>1</sup>The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) may reduce this difference to about 16% instead of approximately 20%. Not all clients are subject to the NIIT. The NIIT is discussed subsequently in this course.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)</em></strong> are retirement arrangements that include the following list:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>IRA Plans Established by Individuals</strong></li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Traditional IRA</li>
<li>Roth IRA</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>IRA Plans Established by Employers </strong></li>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Qualified&rdquo;</strong></em> Plans must be established by employers and are subject to ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) requirements regarding eligibility, vesting, funding, etc. In general, contributions into these plans are not taxed until the funds are withdrawn and employers can claim a deduction for their contributions to these plans in the year the contribution was made.</p>
<p>The most common types of &ldquo;Qualified Plans&rdquo; are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Defined Benefit Plans, including the following:</li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Traditional Defined Benefit Plans</li>
<li>Cash Balance Plans</li>
<li>Fully Insured Defined Benefit Plans</li>
</ul>
<li>Defined Contribution Plans, including the following:&nbsp;</li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Money Purchase Plans</li>
<li>Profit Sharing Plans</li>
<li>401(k) Plans</li>
<li>Stock Bonus Plans/ESOPs</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Although not classified as &ldquo;Qualified Plans,&rdquo; similar plans are available to tax-exempt organizations and government employees. These include the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>403(b) Arrangements</strong> &ndash; These are for tax-exempt religious, charitable, or educational organizations.&nbsp; They allow employees to make elective deferral contributions similar to 401(k) Plans.</li>
<li><strong>Governmental 457(b) Plans &ndash; </strong>These are deferred compensation plans that are available to public sector employees (state or local governments). Similar to 401(k) and 403(b) Plans, they allow employees to make salary deferral contributions.</li>

<p>Because of the important role that IRAs, Qualified Plans, and other employer-sponsored plans play in saving for retirement, it is important that you have a solid understanding of how these tax-advantaged retirement savings vehicles work. Therefore, on the following pages we will examine these plans in detail, beginning with IRAs.</p>
