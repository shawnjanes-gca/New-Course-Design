<p>To make it easier to examine the rules that govern IRAs, let&rsquo;s examine them in two groups: those that can be established by individuals and those that may only be established by employers. There are only two types of IRAs that may be established by an individual: 1) the Traditional IRA; and 2) the Roth IRA.</p>

<p>Traditional IRAs, at times referred to as &ldquo;regular IRAs,&rdquo; are characterized as follows.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Earnings on assets grow on a tax-deferred basis and are taxed only when withdrawals are made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributions can be made (or a Traditional IRA may be established) as long as the taxpayer is under age 70&frac12; on the last day of the tax year and has taxable compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory withdrawals must begin no later than April 1 following the year in which the IRA owner attains age 70&frac12;. Failure to take required distributions results in a penalty of 50% of the under-distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributions taken before age 59&frac12; may incur a 10% premature distribution penalty.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Roth IRA</strong></a></h3>

<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The Roth IRA was created in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA &rsquo;97) and is named after the Senator who was its longtime proponent, William V. Roth of Delaware. Like a Traditional IRA, to establish a Roth IRA, an individual must have taxable compensation. But the Roth IRA differs from the Traditional IRA in the following ways:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Contributions are not deductible</em></strong> on the individual&rsquo;s income tax return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Withdrawals of contributed funds and qualified withdrawals of earnings are free from federal income taxation</em></strong>. Generally speaking, qualified withdrawals of earnings are those made at least 5 years after the first day of the tax year for which the initial contribution to a Roth IRA was made AND due to one of certain specified events (e.g., owner being 59&frac12; or older) that will be discussed in more detail later in the course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>There are no age restrictions</em></strong> to establishing or contributing to the Roth IRA. A client of any age with taxable compensation may contribute to a Roth IRA as long as adjusted gross income does not exceed certain limits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the Traditional IRA, it may be possible to make tax-deductible contributions, but all account earnings and deductible contributions are subject to income taxation upon withdrawal. This is reversed with the Roth IRA. With the Roth IRA, no deduction is available for contributions, but qualified withdrawals are income tax-free.</p>

<p>We revealed that there are really only two forms of the individually established IRA - Traditional and Roth. However, you may see variations on those two forms referred to as &nbsp;<a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton1','','show')" href="#_S"><strong>Spousal IRAs</strong></a> and <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton2','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>Conduit IRAs</strong></a>.

<h4>Spousal IRAs</h4>
<p>This may be the IRA solution for married clients when one spouse does not work outside of the home. While often referred to as another type of IRA, a &ldquo;spousal IRA&rdquo; is really just a Traditional or Roth IRA established for the spouse of the taxpayer.</p>
<p>One of the requirements for creating a Traditional or Roth IRA is that the individual must have taxable compensation. However, <em>an exception to this rule is made for spouses who file a joint tax return</em>: the taxable compensation of one spouse can be applied to the other spouse. This makes it possible for spouse &ldquo;A&rdquo; to qualify a spousal IRA for spouse &ldquo;B&rdquo; when spouse &ldquo;B&rdquo; has no taxable compensation (or insufficient taxable compensation to make full use of that year&rsquo;s contribution limit). <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton3','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example</strong>.</p>

<h4>Conduit IRAs</h4>
<p>A Conduit IRA is either a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA established through a rollover or direct transfer of funds from an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Conduit IRAs may be used when a participant retires or changes jobs.</p>
<p>In the case of job change, a participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan may leave one employer and wish to transfer his or her 401(k) account into the new employer&rsquo;s 401(k) Plan. There may be a waiting period before the employee is eligible to participate in the new employer&rsquo;s 401(k) Plan. The participant may establish a conduit IRA to temporarily &ldquo;park&rdquo; the 401(k) money until it can be transferred to the new employer&rsquo;s 401(k).</p>
<p>A retiring participant can also rollover or direct transfer a qualified plan account balance to a Conduit IRA in order to gain more investment choices.</p>

<h4>Spousal IRA Example</h4>
<p>Sherlock and Irene are married and file married filing jointly. Irene is a world-renowned brain surgeon. She does not participate in any employer-sponsored retirement plan. Sherlock is a professional salt-water angler. They are each 45 years of age. Irene earned $1,400,000 in taxable compensation in the current year. Sherlock had a turbulent year and earned nothing.</p>
<p>Irene may establish a Traditional IRA for herself of $5,500 (2016). Her taxable compensation also qualifies a Spousal IRA of $5,500 (2016) for Sherlock.</p>
Let&rsquo;s consider a variation on this example. Assume the same fact pattern except Irene&rsquo;s taxable compensation is now only $10,000. She may establish an IRA of $5,500 (2016) for herself. Irene&rsquo;s taxable compensation now qualifies a Spousal IRA for Sherlock of only $4,500 (2016). There must be sufficient taxable compensation to cover contributions to both Irene&rsquo;s IRA and Sherlock&rsquo;s spousal IRA.

<h4>Deductible Traditional IRAs</h4>
<p>Contributions to Traditional IRAs are generally deductible by the taxpayer up to the IRA contribution limits. However, when a taxpayer is an active participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the deductibility is limited based upon adjusted gross income.</p>
<p>We will discuss the phase-out of deductibility of deductible Traditional IRA contributions subsequently in this course. Distributions of accumulated earnings and the <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton6','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>original contribution</strong></a> are fully taxable as ordinary income. Capital gains income tax treatment is not available from any IRA withdrawal.</p>

<p><strong>Original Contribution</strong></p>
<p>Why is the taxpayer subject to income tax on the distribution of their original contribution? The taxpayer received a deduction on their income tax return when the original contribution was made. Consequently, the taxpayer must include the original contribution into income when distributed.</p>

<h4>Nondeductible Traditional IRAs</h4>
<p>Contributions to nondeductible Traditional IRAs are not deductible by the taxpayer. Distributions of deferred earnings are taxable to the taxpayer as ordinary income.
