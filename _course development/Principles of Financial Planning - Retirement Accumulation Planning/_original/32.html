<p>Small business owners are attracted to the SEP for its simplicity, low set-up costs, and inexpensive annual administrative costs. With a SEP, individual IRAs are established for each employee. Self-employed individuals may open a SEP IRA, in which case the individual is both the employee and the employer. Once the employer makes contributions, these SEP IRAs are subject to the same rules regarding transfer, withdrawal and taxation as a Traditional IRA. Uniquely, the SEP IRA has been called the <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>procrastinator&rsquo;s retirement plan</strong></a> because of its liberal set-up deadlines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a SEP IRA, only employer contributions are permitted - employee salary reduction deferrals are not allowed.
