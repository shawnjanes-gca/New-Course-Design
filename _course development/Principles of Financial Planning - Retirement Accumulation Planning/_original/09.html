<p>How would your client react to a strategy that provided a guaranteed lifetime income in retirement, tax-deferred growth, and unlimited contributions during the accumulation period? An annuity can give your client all of those benefits and more. This course is centered upon accumulation planning, so an annuity that defers distributions to retirement, a deferred annuity, is our focus in the discussion that follows.</p>
<p>An annuity is simply a contract that provides a series of periodic payments to an individual referred to as the annuitant. While a detailed analysis of annuities is beyond the scope for this course, we will summarize select characteristics of this powerful retirement accumulation tool.</p>
<p>Annuities can be described in a number of different ways, as the following chart will demonstrate. <strong style="color: #ff0004;">Click each to learn more.</strong></p>

<p>An immediate annuity begins distributing annuity payments to the annuitant immediately after the annuity is purchased. In contrast, a deferred annuity begins distributions of annuity payments to the annuitant in the future. Generally, a client who has already contributed the maximum to any <a id="clockButton" onclick="toggleClock()" href="#_s"><strong>tax-deferred accounts</strong></a> may be a candidate for a deferred annuity. Deferred annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream at retirement and may resonate with clients concerned about running out of money before they run out of life.</p>

<p>A fixed annuity pays a fixed amount over the distribution period and a variable annuity pays a varying amount over the distribution period. A fixed annuity may not always provide inflation protection (such protection may be available at additional cost) or give the annuity owner a voice in selecting investments. A variable annuity provides the annuity owner with a choice over annuity investments and may provide an opportunity to maintain an inflation-adjusted annuity payout. In a variable annuity, the payment fluctuates up or down based upon investment performance of the annuity&rsquo;s investments.</p>

<h4>Covered Employment</h4>
<p>If Social Security and Medicare taxes are being withheld from your client&rsquo;s paycheck, then their employment is covered employment. The following types of employment are not covered employment and hence, Social Security taxes are not withheld and the workers are not eligible for Social Security benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Railroad workers with their own retirement system outside of Social Security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal government employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes because they participate in a separate retirement system outside of Social Security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State and local governments may opt out of Social Security and establish separate retirement plans for their employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clergy may opt out of Social Security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
Noteworthy, self-employment is also generally considered covered employment.

<h4>Credit</h4>
<p>A worker receives one credit for each $1,220 (2015, as indexed) in compensation earned from covered employment. A maximum of four credits can be earned each year.</p>
<p>A credit<strong></strong>is also frequently and mistakenly referred to as a quarter of coverage. This can be confusing because a worker may earn four credits in the first quarter of the year. Hence, it is less confusing and more accurate to describe this requirement in terms of&nbsp; &ldquo;credits&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Payroll Taxes</h4>
<p>Employees pay Social Security taxes of 6.2% on compensation from covered employment up to a certain limit. That limit is called the taxable wage base. The taxable wage base is $118,500 in 2015, as indexed. Here is an interesting observation - the taxable wage base has increased four times faster than inflation since the first taxable wage base was set at $3,000 in 1937.</p>
<p>Employees also pay a Medicare tax of 1.45% of ALL compensation without limit. While our focus is not Medicare in this discussion, you should know how these taxes are assessed. A new tax - the 0.9% Medicare Surtax - is also payable by the employee on earned income in excess of certain thresholds. Employers are required to match the 6.2% Social Security tax and the 1.45% Medicare tax withheld from employees. Employers do not match the 0.9% Medicare Surtax.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Anita Advisor earned $160,000 in 2015 as an employee of a national financial services firm. Remember that the Social Security taxable wage base is $118,500 (2015, as indexed). Anita will have $9,574 withheld from her pay as the following calculation illustrates.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$7,347 Social Security tax (6.2% of $118,500)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$2,320 Medicare tax (1.45% of 160,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$9,667 Total Social Security and Medicare Tax Withheld</p>
</li>
</ul>
Anita&rsquo;s employer must match this $9,667 and will send a check to IRS for $19,334. Her earned income is such that she is not subject to the 0.9% Medicare Surtax.</td>

<p>Self-employed workers are both employee and employer. Hence, the self-employed have the dubious distinction of paying both the employee and employer portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes. The self-employed receive an income tax deduction for the employer portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)</h4>
<p>A worker is not paid 100% of her average earnings when she retires. Average earnings are reduced through a formula to develop a worker&rsquo;s PIA. The PIA is biased in favor of those with relatively lower earnings.</p>
<p>A deep dive into the PIA calculation is beyond the scope of this course. However, you should know that the largest percentage increases to PIA come from the bottom end of average earnings. For example, 90% of the first $826 (2015, as indexed) in average earnings per month is added to PIA, but only 15% of average earnings per month above $4,980 (2015, as indexed) is added to PIA. Average earnings above the taxable wage base ($118,500 in 2015) add nothing to PIA.</p>

<h4>Claiming Age</h4>
<p>The age at which a worker applies for retirement benefits is the worker&rsquo;s claiming age. A worker has three choices: 1) claim early and take a permanently reduced benefit; 2) claim on time at normal retirement age (age 65 to 67 depending upon year of birth) and receive a benefit of 100% of PIA; or 3) delay claiming and receive a permanently increased benefit.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>
<p>Early - A worker may claim no earlier than age 62. Workers claiming at age 62 incur a permanent reduction from their PIA. Workers claiming after age 62 but before their normal retirement age will have their retirement benefit reduced for each month they claim early based upon a formula. A worker retiring at age 62 will incur a 20% reduction if their normal retirement age is 65 and a 30% reduction if their normal retirement age is age 67.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Your client Earl&rsquo;s full retirement age is 67 and his PIA is $2,000. If Earl retires at age 62, his monthly retirement benefit will be reduced by $600 (30%). Earl will receive a monthly benefit of only $1,400. Earl&rsquo;s benefit WILL NOT increase to $2,000 when he reaches age 67. The reduction of benefits is permanent.</p>

<li>
<p>On Time - A worker may claim at their normal retirement age and receive 100% of their PIA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delay - A worker may delay claiming beyond their normal retirement age and earn a permanent increase to their retirement benefit of as much as 8% per year (if born in or after 1943) for each year of delay through age 70. No increases are earned if claiming is delayed past age 70.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Belinda was born in 1954 and has a normal retirement age of 66. Belinda&rsquo;s PIA is $2,000. If she claims at age 66, her monthly retirement check will be $2,000 (100% of her PIA).</p>
<p>If she delays retirement until age 70, her monthly retirement check will permanently increase to $2,640, a 32% increase. The 32% increase is calculated as 4 years of delay at 8% per year.</p>

</ol>
<p>Social Security designs the early, on time, and delayed claiming amounts so that the present value of all future benefits for a client living to his expected actuarial age is approximately equal no matter what claiming age is chosen.</p>
