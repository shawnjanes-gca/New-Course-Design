<h2>Corporate and Keogh Sponsors of Qualified Plans</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A corporation may sponsor any of the qualified plans. Unincorporated sponsors, called Keogh sponsors, may not adopt Stock Bonus or ESOP Plans. Why? Keogh sponsors, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships, do not manifest ownership of the business through stock certificates and hence, cannot adopt any qualified plan that requires employer stock.</p>
<p>Keogh Plans are substantially similar to qualified plans sponsored by corporations, except the business owners or partners deduct their plan contributions on their personal tax return, while non-owner employees do not report the contributions on their behalf either as income or as a deduction.</p>
<p>Plans adopted by an incorporated business may be referred to as either Keogh Plans, HR-10 Plans, or Keogh (HR-10) Plans.</p>
