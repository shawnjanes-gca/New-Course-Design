    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A high net worth, high-income prospect is in your office seeking fresh ideas to defer income into her retirement years. She&rsquo;s been singularly unimpressed with the stale advice received from her current advisor.</p>
  <p>You can show her how to <strong><em>defer hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in income</em></strong> for retirement using a &ldquo;Spigot Trust.&rdquo; The potential income tax deferral from Spigot Trust earnings is limited only by your client&rsquo;s contributions, which are not limited by law!</p>
  <p>This trust functions as an income spigot by turning income distributions off during the retirement accumulation phase and turning income distributions on during the distribution phase of retirement.</p>
  <p>The Spigot Trust is an irrevocable charitable trust technically referred to as the Net Income with Make-up Charitable Remainder UniTrust (<strong>NIMCRUT</strong>). We will refer to the NIMCRUT by its more client-friendly nickname, the Spigot Trust, in this discussion.</p>
  <div id="p7SMLcontent_1" class="sml-content">
    <div id="p7SMLwrapper_1"><p>A <strong><em>Net Income with Make-up Charitable Remainder UniTrust (NIMCRUT)</em></strong> is simply a variation of the basic Charitable Remainder Trust.<br>
A basic Charitable Remainder Trust works in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your client (the donor) contributes assets (the initial contribution) to an irrevocable Charitable Remainder Trust.</li>
    <li>After initial contribution, the Charitable Remainder Trust distributes an annual payout to a non-charitable beneficiary (generally your client if retirement accumulation is the goal).</li>
    <li>A charity of your client&rsquo;s choosing receives the remainder of the trust when the trust terminates (generally at the death of your client).</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example-box"><h3>More Information on Charitable Remainder Trusts</h3>
  
  <p>1. The trust can provide income for one or more beneficiaries. Frequently, only the donor or the donor and his/her spouse are named as the income beneficiaries, so as to avoid gift tax issues associated with naming anyone else.</p>
  <p>2.	The trust can be written to terminate upon the death of the income beneficiary (referred to as the non-charitable beneficiary) or upon their combined deaths if more than one. Alternatively, the trust can be written to terminate at the end of a specific number of years, not to exceed 20 years.</p>
  <p>3.	The annual payout to the income beneficiary(ies) cannot be less than 5% or more than 50% of the value of the trust. Depending upon the type of the Charitable Remainder Trust selected, the annual payout is either fixed at the initial contribution date or varies based upon the trust’s value.</p>
  <p>4.	At time of trust creation, the charity must have an actuarial expectation to receive at least 10% of the initial contribution to the trust.</p>

<p>Prospects for a Spigot Trust have typically exhausted all traditional methods of retirement accumulation and tend to place a high value upon the following:</p>

              <p>A genuine charitable intent is a virtual prerequisite for Spigot Trusts. These trusts are, at their heart, Charitable Irrevocable Trusts in which a charity will receive the assets remaining in the trust at some future event, such as the death of your client.</p>
              <p>The Spigot Trust can be impactful for accumulating income for future payment to your client. Yet, you will want to clearly communicate that the assets remaining in the trust at the termination of the trust will be lost to the family forever. However, this downside can frequently be addressed using a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Wealth &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eplacement &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;rust&lt;/em&gt; owns life insurance used to replace some of the family wealth eroded by charitable gifts.

              <p>Clients or prospects with significant net worth and cash flow, especially those who have become successful late in life or who have procrastinated in retirement accumulation saving, may be attracted to the Spigot Trust&rsquo;s ability to accumulate significant amounts of supplemental retirement income.</p>

                <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
                <p><strong><em>Note – There is an abundance of Spigot Trust design choices. This example denotes but one of those design choices.</em></strong></p>
                <p>Your client Allison (age 46) established a Spigot Trust in the current year by contributing $1,000,000 in highly-appreciated Coca-Cola stock to the trust.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong><em>The Trust document requires that Allison receive the lesser of current year income </em></strong><em>(defined as dividends and interest)<strong> OR 5% of trust assets </strong></em>every year until her age 65<strong><em>.</em></strong> The 5% is called the &ldquo;stated payout percentage.&rdquo;  </li>
                  <li>What happens if the income generated by the trust is less than 5% in any year? In that case, Allison receives a payout of less than 5%. To the extent Allison receives less than 5% in any year, the amount under distributed is tracked for potential payout to Allison during her retirement years.</li>
                  <li>The stated payout percentage must be selected when the trust is created, cannot be changed, and must range from a minimum of 5% to maximum of 50%.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following happens next: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The trustee may or may not choose to sell the Coca-Cola stock. Since the trust is income tax exempt, no capital gains taxes are paid by the trust if the Coca-Cola stock is sold.</li>
                  <li>From Allison&rsquo;s age 46 to age 65 (20 years), the Trust invests only in growth securities paying <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;We acknowledge that it may be difficult to avoid all dividends; however, we assume &lt;em&gt;no dividends&lt;/em&gt; merely for the purpose of keeping this example as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">no dividends</a>. The Trust invests in no interest income generating securities. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Average annual return during this period is 8%, derived 100% from growth in the market value of the portfolio. </li>
                  <li>The Trust receives no &ldquo;income&rdquo;; hence, Allison receives no payout from the Trust from her age 46 through age 65.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Spigot Trust magic starts with the following: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Because the Spigot Trust is an income tax exempt entity, the 8% annual return compounds tax-free.</li>
                  <li>By Allison&rsquo;s age 65, the market value of the trust will have grown to approximately $4.3MM.</li>
                  <li>The trustee will change the investment allocation of the trust to generate at least 5% in income annually beginning at Allison&rsquo;s age 65.</li>
                  <li>Allison, beginning at her age 65, will receive approximately $215,000 (5% of $4.3MM) annually for the rest of her life.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>But there&rsquo;s more! Remember all of those years during which Allison received no payout? </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The payout she did not receive is referred to as an <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;The IRS refers to the &lt;em&gt;under&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt; as the &ldquo;Make Up Account.&rdquo; Hence, the official IRS name for the Spigot Trust is the Net Income with &lt;strong&gt;Make-Up&lt;/strong&gt; Charitable Remainder UniTrust.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">under-distribution</a>. </li>
                  <li>The under-distribution may be paid out periodically to Allison during her retirement years as a supplemental distribution <em>in addition to</em> the 5% payout percentage stated in the trust document.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Caveat</strong> - The under-distribution can only be paid out to Allison in those retirement years for which trust income (interest and dividends) exceeds the stated payout percentage of 5%. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Not all market cycles will be ideal for this strategy. <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specialized investment techniques&lt;/em&gt; may include the use of deferred annuities, zero coupon bonds, and other methods to time the flow of income into the Spigot Trust. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attention: Consult with your internal compliance team and a Trust Attorney before discussing specialized investment techniques with clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">Specialized investment techniques</a> may be required for the Spigot Trust to function effectively in low interest rate market environments. </li>

  <p>The Spigot Trust, although impressive, is not retirement accumulation Utopia. The sobering disadvantages of this strategy include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spigot Trusts are irrevocable. Amounts remaining in the trust at the trust&rsquo;s termination go to charity and are lost to the family forever.</li>
    <li>Specialized investment techniques may be required for the trust to function effectively in low interest rate markets.</li>
    <li>Spigot Trust agreements are often scrutinized by the IRS, thus due diligence should be taken in drawing up the agreement.</li>
    <li>Hard-to-value assets, such as closely-held business interests, are not generally appropriate.</li>
    <li>Income distributions from the trust to the non-charitable beneficiary are generally taxed at ordinary income tax rates.</li>
