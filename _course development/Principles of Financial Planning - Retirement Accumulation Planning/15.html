  <p>To make it easier to examine the rules that govern IRAs, let&rsquo;s examine them in two groups: those that can be established by individuals and those that may only be established by employers. There are only two types of IRAs that may be established by an individual: 1) the Traditional IRA; and 2) the Roth IRA. </p>

              <p>Traditional IRAs, at times referred to as &ldquo;regular IRAs,&rdquo; are characterized as follows.</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Earnings on assets grow on      a tax-deferred basis and are taxed only when withdrawals are made.</li>
                <li>Contributions can be made      (or a Traditional IRA may be established) as long as the taxpayer is under      age 70½ on the last day of the tax year and has taxable compensation.</li>
                <li>Mandatory withdrawals must      begin no later than April 1 following the year in which the IRA owner      attains age 70½. Failure to take required distributions results in a      penalty of 50% of the under-distribution.</li>
                <li>Distributions taken before age 59½ may incur a 10% premature distribution penalty.</li>
              </ul>

<p>Traditional IRAs may be either Deductible Traditional IRAs or Nondeductible Traditional IRAs.</p>

              <p><strong>Roth IRA</strong></p>
              <p>The Roth IRA was created in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA &rsquo;97) and is named after the Senator who was its longtime proponent, William V. Roth of Delaware. Like a Traditional IRA, to establish a Roth IRA, an individual must have taxable compensation. But the Roth IRA differs from the Traditional IRA in the following ways:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>With the Traditional IRA, it may be possible to make tax-deductible contributions, but all account earnings and deductible contributions are subject to income taxation upon withdrawal. This is reversed with the Roth IRA. With the Roth IRA, no deduction is available for contributions, but qualified withdrawals are income tax-free.</p>

<p>We revealed that there are really only two forms of the individually established IRA - Traditional and Roth. However, you may see variations on those two forms referred to as  Spousal IRAs and Conduit IRAs. These variations are NOT separate types of IRAs.</p>
