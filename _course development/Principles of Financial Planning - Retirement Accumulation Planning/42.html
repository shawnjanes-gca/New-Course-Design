  </h1>
  <p>Distributions to a qualified plan participant who is still employed by the sponsor and still participating in the sponsor&rsquo;s qualified plan are called <strong>in-service withdrawals.  </strong>The qualified plan administrator is generally required to withhold 20% for taxes from the amount of the in-service withdrawal, unless the distribution is transferred to an eligible retirement plan by means of a direct rollover.</p>
  <p>In general, Defined Benefit, Cash Balance, Target Benefit, and Money Purchase retirement plans do not permit in-service withdrawals before age 62. Other qualified plans may allow in-service withdrawals.  The table below identifies which retirement plans may allow in-service withdrawals. In many cases, the plans are not required to offer in-service withdrawals, merely permitted to do so. Your client should check with the plan administrator to determine availability of in-service withdrawals.</p>

<p>The entire in-service distribution from a qualified plan will generally be taxable as ordinary income.  In-service withdrawals from qualified plans or Section 403(b) Plans may also be subject to a premature distribution penalty of 10% of the taxable amount withdrawn, although there are various exceptions to the 10% premature distribution penalty, as discussed on the next page.</p>
