  <p>The government will take fewer taxes in retirement when wise tax choices are made during the accumulation period. The ideas we will share may give the shrewd advisor an opportunity to reduce not only a client&rsquo;s regular income taxes in retirement, but potentially reduce more subtle erosion of retirement income as well.</p>
  <p>In the pages that follow, we will address the &ldquo;must know&rdquo; dynamics of IRAs and employer-sponsored retirement plans. We will also dive beneath the surface of income tax efficiency and share specific strategies to dramatically reduce or avoid other retirement expenses, such as excess Medicare insurance premiums, after-tax medical costs, and the Net Investment Income tax.</p>
