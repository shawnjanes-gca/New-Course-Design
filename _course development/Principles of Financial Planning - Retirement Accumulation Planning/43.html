  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Qualified Plan Premature Distribution Penalty</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A 10% penalty will generally be levied against any plan withdrawal by a participant if the distribution is made before the participant&rsquo;s attainment of age 59½.  However, there is no penalty for the following premature distributions from qualified plans if made:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>To the estate or the beneficiaries following the participant&rsquo;s death</li>
      <li>As a result of the participant&rsquo;s total and permanent disability</li>
      <li>Withdrawals are substantially equal annual installments spread over the participant&rsquo;s life expectancy, or the joint life expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary. The payments under this exception, except in the case of death or disability, must continue for at least five years or until the employee reaches age 59½, whichever is the longer period. This exception only applies after separation from service.</li>
      <li>After your separation from service in or after the year you reached age 55 (age 50 for public safety employees).</li>
      <li>For payment on an IRS levy</li>
      <li>For the purpose of paying medical expenses in excess of 10% of the participant&rsquo;s Adjusted Gross Income</li>
      <li>Pursuant to a judicial decree under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order</li>
    </ul>
</div>
  <!-- example-box -->
<p>In the case of the substantially equal annual installments exception, the payments must continue for the later of the participant&rsquo;s attainment of age 59½ or 5 years. For example, if the participant commences the installments at age 57, then the participant must continue withdrawing payments until reaching age 62 (5 years later).</p>
<p>Please note that there are differences between the above list of exceptions and those for the IRA premature exceptions discussed previously.</p>
