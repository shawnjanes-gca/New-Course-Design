  <p>The Employee Benefit Research Institute® reports in its <em>2014 RCS Fact Sheet #6</em> that less than half of workers have even tried to calculate the amount they need to save to live comfortably in retirement. The report goes on to reveal, not surprisingly, that <strong><em>workers who have calculated a savings amount &ldquo;tend to have higher levels of savings.&rdquo;</em></strong> The mere calculation of the amount influences savings behavior!</p>
  <p>The most critical question to answer in developing a sufficient savings plan is, &quot;<strong><em>What is the total cumulative amount I need to save?&quot;</em></strong> Only when that question is answered does it become possible to set specific savings goals and select appropriate savings vehicles.</p>
  <p>There are multiple methods for answering this question. Some methods start with expenses, preparing an individual expense budget and adjusting from there; the resulting adjusted budget is then used as the retirement income goal. Others start with current income and adjust it by anticipated changes to expenses, either by identifying specific expenses for which income will no longer be needed or by a rule-of-thumb percentage (e.g., 70-80% of current income).</p>
  <p>Regardless of the method, the identified level of income is then adjusted for inflation to identify the level of income that will be needed upon retirement to maintain the current standard of living.</p>
  <p>Once the future level of desired income is determined, we identify all potential sources of retirement income. These existing sources of income are subtracted from total income desired to identify the amount of additional retirement income needed (the shortfall). That shortfall will need to be generated by additional retirement accumulations.</p>
  <p>Retirement income is usually generated by a combination of Social Security benefits, annuities, employer-sponsored retirement plans, and personal savings, such as IRAs.  Employer-sponsored plans and IRAs are analyzed later in this course. Social Security and annuities are presented now.  </p>
