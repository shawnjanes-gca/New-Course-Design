  <p>The preceding page concluded our discussion of qualified plans. Our focus now changes to nonqualified plans sponsored by tax-exempt organizations and the government. Why should you know this material? An affluent client may have a background with employment in a tax-exempt organization or in the public sector!</p><!-- Insert Image to the right -->

              <p>A Governmental 457(b) Plan (also referred to as a Public 457(b) Plan) is a deferred compensation plan that is limited to public sector employees (state or local governments that meet the statutory requirements listed in Section 457). While 457 Plans are not Qualified Plans, they allow employees to make salary deferral contributions similar to 401(k) Plans. The deferral may not to exceed the lesser of (a) $18,000, with an additional $6,000 if age 50 or over, or (b) 100% of the participant&rsquo;s compensation (in 2016).</p>
              <p>These plans offer a &ldquo;double dipping&rdquo; and potentially a unique &ldquo;triple dipping&rdquo; opportunity for employee deferrals. Let&rsquo;s start with understanding the &ldquo;double dip.&rdquo; Contributions to a Governmental 457(b) Plan have no impact upon deferral limits in other salary reduction plans such as 401(k) and 403(b) Plans. If an employee has the ability to contribute to both a 401(k) Plan and a Governmental 457(b) Plan, then neither plan takes into account the deferrals of the other for purposes of staying within the maximum deferral limits. This effectively doubles the annual deferral limit for such an employee.</p>
              <p>If your client likes the &ldquo;double dip,&rdquo; he or she may love the &ldquo;triple dip.&rdquo; During the last three years of employment, a 457(b) participant age 50 or older may defer an additional special catch-up amount of up to another $18,000 (2016, as indexed). The age-related $6,000 deferral may not be taken in the same year as the special catch-up deferral.</p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box">
                <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
                <p>Henrietta (age 60) earns $100,000 annually as an employee of a government agency that sponsors a 457(b) Plan. She is in her last three years of service before retirement. She also earns $30,000 annually as an employee of a private corporation that sponsors a 401(k) Plan.</p>
                <p>She may defer a maximum of $60,000 of her salary in 2016 as follows.</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>$24,000 Private Corporation 401(k) Plan (includes age-related $6,000)</li>
                  <li>$18,000 Government 457(b) Plan standard deferral</li>
                  <li>$18,000 Government 457(b) Plan special catch-up contribution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>During any year she uses the $18,000 457(b) special catch-up contribution, she may not use the age-related $6,000 457(b) catch-up.</p>

  <p>Employers can add a Roth feature to a Governmental 457(b) Plan as of 2011. In a Roth 457(b), employees elect to designate their salary deferrals as Roth contributions. Such deferrals are made on an after-tax basis, but retirement distributions of such funds and the earnings on them will not be taxed. Unlike a Roth IRA, there are no modified AGI limits that phase out eligibility for participation. Also unlike a Roth IRA, distributions are required during the owner’s lifetime based upon required minimum distribution rules.</p>
