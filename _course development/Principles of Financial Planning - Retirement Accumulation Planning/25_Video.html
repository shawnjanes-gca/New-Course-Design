  </h1>
  <p>This is one of the major decisions that clients routinely face and merits a closer examination. We will approach this decision as any other financial decision - by comparing benefits and costs. Specifically, our discussion will begin with an overview followed by an analysis of significant factors in the conversion decision.</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Your client may convert account balances from a broad range of account types to a Roth IRA. The conversion results in inclusion of any untaxed amounts into income.</p>

  <p><h3>Benefits of Conversion</h3></p>
<p class="pageInstruction">The promise of a tax-free income stream is usually the first and primary driver behind conversion of pretax qualified plan or Traditional IRA accounts to a Roth IRA. Clients expecting to pay higher income tax rates in retirement may benefit from conversion. However, as we will demonstrate subsequently, even clients expecting income tax rates to remain the same or drop slightly may also benefit from conversion.</p>
<p class="pageInstruction">The flexibility to take or avoid Roth IRA distributions during retirement is a second powerful benefit.</p>
<p class="pageInstruction">A third set of benefits includes the potential reduction of other costs, such as income tax on Social Security retirement benefits, minimization of the 3.8% Net Investment Income tax, and reduction of certain Medicare premiums. We will provide additional detail on these opportunities later in this course in &ldquo; Lowering AGI is a Good Thing - Roth IRA Unique Planning Opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Costs of Conversion</h3>
<p class="pageInstruction">Income tax must be paid on any untaxed amounts for the year of conversion. However, the true tax cost may exceed merely the income tax payable on converted amounts. Because conversion may dramatically increase your client&rsquo;s adjusted gross income in the conversion year, your client&rsquo;s marginal tax rate may increase.</p>
<p class="pageInstruction">If that were not enough, the increase to adjusted gross income may cause the reduction or loss of itemized deductions and exemptions under the phase-out rules governing those deductions. Your client may also lose eligibility for education credits and student loan interest deductions. The moral of the story is that the income tax on the converted untaxed income may be just a part of the total tax cost!</p>

<h3>Life Expectancy</h3>
<p class="pageInstruction">Longer life expectancy means collecting more tax-free Roth IRA income in retirement. Assuming that your client&rsquo;s income tax rate is higher or approximately the same in retirement than in the conversion year, longer life expectancies provide greater after-tax income streams than shorter life expectancies.</p>
<p>But that is not the whole story. If we broaden our perspective from your client to include your client’s heirs, then a slightly different picture may emerge. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here for an example.</span></p>

<p><h3>Beneficiary Designation</h3></p>
<p>Beneficiary designations are not the primary driver for the conversion decision for most clients. However, just as your client&rsquo;s income tax rates impact the conversion decision, beneficiary income tax rates should be considered as well.</p>
<p>For example, if the beneficiary is a tax-exempt charity, the charity will receive fewer dollars after conversion to a Roth IRA than before conversion. This assumes that conversion-related income taxes were paid with Traditional IRA funds.</p>
<p>What if the beneficiary is a loved one, such as child or grandchild? In this case, the higher the beneficiary&rsquo;s income tax rate, the more beneficial the inherited Roth IRA will be.</p><h3>Comparing Benefits and Costs
</h3>
<p>Your internal resources and your client’s CPA or CFP® professional should be consulted for your client’s specific needs and financial profile. An online calculator<sup>1</sup> may also give general guidance in balancing costs and benefits.</p>
