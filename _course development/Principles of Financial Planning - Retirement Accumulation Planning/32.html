    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Small business owners are attracted to the SEP for its simplicity, low set-up costs, and inexpensive annual administrative costs. With a SEP, individual IRAs are established for each employee. Self-employed individuals may open a SEP IRA, in which case the individual is both the employee and the employer. Once the employer makes contributions, these SEP IRAs are subject to the same rules regarding transfer, withdrawal and taxation as a Traditional IRA. Uniquely, the SEP IRA has been called the procrastinator&rsquo;s retirement plan because of its liberal set-up deadlines.</p>

                <p>In a SEP IRA, only employer contributions are permitted - employee salary reduction deferrals are not allowed. However, prior to January 1, 1997, a SEP IRA could have included a salary reduction arrangement (known as a SARSEP) whereby employees could elect to defer compensation and have the funds placed in an IRA.  While a SARSEP created prior to that date may continue to function, new SARSEP plans cannot be created. They have been replaced with SIMPLE Plans.</p>

  <p>Employee deferrals are not permitted in a SEP. However, employee deferrals were permitted in a previous version of the SEP, the Salary Reduction SEP (SARSEP). New SARSEPs were not allowed after 1996, but SARSEPs existing as of that date may continue to operate.</p>
