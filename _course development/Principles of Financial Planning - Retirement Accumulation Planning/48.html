<p>The North Star<sup>1</sup> guiding our discussion on the preceding pages was based upon the following three goals:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>
<p>Broadening your retirement accumulation planning expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elevating your understanding of the key issues associated with this phase of retirement planning and how they can be resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing your ability to guide clients through the retirement accumulation planning process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope you have taken advantage of this course to better plan your own retirement accumulation. We further hope that you will use that personal process as a springboard to better advise your clients.</p>
<p>Entire books have been written on many of the individual topics presented to you in this course. We have worked with focus and diligence in bringing you the vital concepts you simply must know while avoiding a love-fest with details of lesser importance. Because many of these concepts are deep, wide, and subject to statutory change, we strongly encourage follow-up with your firm&rsquo;s internal technical and compliance resources as you develop alternatives and make recommendations to clients. Consultation with your client&rsquo;s CPA, CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> Certificant or other financial professional is recommended where appropriate as well.</p>
This concludes your course on retirement accumulation planning. While we have provided you with an in-depth overview of different retirement plans and the rules associated with them, it is up to you to begin leveraging this knowledge to assist your clients!
