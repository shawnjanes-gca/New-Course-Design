  <p>These plans do not define the benefits the employee receives upon retirement. Rather, they define the procedures under which contributions <strong>may or may not</strong> be made by the participant or employer to each participant's account. Contributions are not always guaranteed in Defined Contribution Plans. Benefits upon retirement depend on the amount of plan contributions, how long they have to grow and the investment performance of the funds that are contributed.  This shift of investment responsibility from the employer and reduced cost are the primary reasons these plans have become much more popular with employers than DB Plans. Our focus in this discussion is on the most widely available Defined Contribution Plans.</p>

              <p>Profit Sharing Plans are a popular type of plan because they have the greatest employer flexibility. They were initially developed to encourage employees to work hard for the corporation to be profitable, with the expectation that the company would contribute money into the employees&rsquo; accounts when corporate profits were realized. Employer contributions to a Profit Sharing Plan are generally discretionary in that the employer decides if, when, and how much to contribute. Annual contributions are not required.</p>
              <p>Compared to Defined Benefit Category Plans, Profit Sharing Plans are relatively inexpensive to set up and administer. <strong>Employees bear investment risk in this type of plan since the investment performance of plan assets directly affects the amount of their retirement benefits.  As in any qualified plan, pre-tax contributions, growth, and earnings of plan assets are not taxed until withdrawn by the plan participant. Contributions are subject to statutory </strong>limits<strong>. </strong>Employer contributions are required on a substantial and recurring basis, but not every year.</p>

              <p>The rate of contribution to a Money Purchase Plan is <strong>fixed</strong>. Once the employer fixes a percent of compensation that is to be placed into the plan, the employer must make that tax-deductible contribution each year, even if there are no profits for the year.</p>

              <p><strong>A Stock Bonus Plan is very similar to a Profit Sharing Plan, but the participant accounts are invested in stock of the employer company. Employer contributions to the plan are either stocks or contributions of cash that the plan uses to purchase employer stock. These contributions are tax-deductible to the employer.</strong></p>
              <p>An ESOP is a type of Stock Bonus Plan. However, an ESOP is designed to allow the ESOP Plan to borrow money from a lending institution. The plan uses the loan proceeds to purchase employer stock. The employer makes tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP Plan (within certain limits), which the ESOP then uses to pay interest and principal on the loan. This enables the employer to borrow funds and repay both principal and interest with tax-deductible dollars.</p>
              <p>Employees bear investment risk in these plans since the investment performance of plan assets directly affects the amount of their retirement benefits. ESOPs<strong> can broaden stock ownership, which may make takeover more difficult, may incent employees, increase marketability of shares, but may dilute the primary owners&rsquo; ownership percentage.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>As in any qualified plan, taxation to the participant of contributions and earnings of plan assets are deferred until withdrawn by the participant. In addition, participants in a Stock Bonus Plan or ESOP can elect net unrealized appreciation treatment with respect to employer securities.</strong></p>
              <p>These plans are subject to the same funding and deduction limits as Profit Sharing Plans. Employer contributions are required on a substantial and recurring basis, but not every year.</p>
