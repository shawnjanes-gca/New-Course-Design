  <p>The April 2014 Social Security Administration’s <em>Basic Facts</em> report discloses that the elderly derive almost four of every ten dollars of their income from Social Security. Ironically, a national survey conducted by the Financial Literacy Center<sup>1</sup> for the Social Security Administration revealed that only 22% of financial advisors feel “very knowledgeable” about Social Security.</p>
  <p>Social Security provides a powerful combination of lifetime payments, federal guarantees, and an inflation-adjusted income stream. The savvy advisor will develop expertise in this foundational retirement income benefit. We will help you develop expertise, and hopefully confidence, in Social Security retirement planning during the accumulation phase by focusing upon these aspects: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Design and operation of Social Security</li>
    <li>Calculating retirement benefits </li>
    <li>Avoiding common mistakes</li>
    <li>Social Security financial solvency</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Design and Operation of Social Security</h3>
  <p>Social Security pays benefits, subject to eligibility rules, when a worker retires, becomes disabled, or dies. The worker&rsquo;s spouse, former spouse, and children may also become eligible for benefits when the worker becomes entitled or dies. Understanding retirement benefits is our focus in this course.</p>
  <p>Social Security retirement benefits give comfort to clients concerned about outliving their money and the potential ravages of inflation. Under current law, qualifying workers will receive an inflation-adjusted retirement benefit for life, no matter how long they live.</p>
  <p>Before a worker can receive retirement benefits, he or she must have credit for a required amount of work in covered employment<!-- Tooltip -->. Retirement benefits are earned only if a worker is fully insured. A worker is generally fully insured for retirement benefits if he or she has forty <!-- Tooltip --> credits <!-- Tooltip -->. Once a worker is fully insured for retirement purposes, he or she remains fully insured for life.</p>

<p>Where does the money to pay benefits come from?  Social Security is funded by <!-- Tooltip --> payroll taxes <!-- Tooltip --> assessed against employers, employees, and the self-employed.</p>
  <p>The Social Security Administration deserves a special call-out for its operational efficiency.  For every dollar paid out in benefits in 2013, less than one cent was used to pay administrative expenses according to Social Security&rsquo;s official website in a report entitled, &ldquo;<em>Social Security Administrative Expenses</em>.&rdquo;</p><h3>Calculating Retirement Benefits</h3>
  <p>The size of a client&rsquo;s Social Security retirement check is based on average career earnings and retirement age. The calculation begins with the average, adjusted for inflation, of the highest 35 years of earnings. The average is expressed in monthly terms and is referred to as &ldquo;average indexed monthly earnings&rdquo; (AIME). We will refer to AIME as average earnings in this course. A worker&rsquo;s average earnings are used to calculate their <!-- Tooltip --> primary insurance amount (PIA) <!-- Tooltip -->. A worker&rsquo;s monthly retirement payment may be less than PIA, exactly PIA, or more than PIA based upon the <!-- Tooltip --> claiming age <!-- Tooltip --> chosen.</p><p><h3>Avoiding Common Social Security Mistakes During the Accumulation Period</h3></p>
  <p>Maximizing the future Social Security retirement benefit requires avoiding common mistakes during a client&rsquo;s accumulation period. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>If earnings during any year are zero, that zero becomes part of the average and reduces a worker&rsquo;s retirement benefit. Hence, an able worker should consider working until there are at least 35 years with earnings from covered employment. This is especially true of the primary wage earner in a married couple but may be less impactful for the <!-- Tooltip --> spouse with lesser earnings. <!-- Tooltip --> </p>

              <p>Here is an interesting opportunity. Even after all &ldquo;zero&rdquo; years have been replaced by earnings years, there may be even more to gain by continued employment. A worker&rsquo;s average earnings generally increase when a new higher year of earnings replaces an older lower year of inflation-adjusted earnings. Frequently, a late career client may be in their top earnings years and, if so, this strategy could well increase the future monthly retirement benefit check.</p>

              <p>The impact of errors or omissions in one&rsquo;s earnings statement is generally minimal if found and corrected early. An annual review of one&rsquo;s Social Security benefit statement is advised. This simple step may avoid real problems 20 or 30 years in the future when records, or even the employer, may be difficult to locate.

  <p>Your understanding of these foundational Social Security concepts, such as claiming age and mistakes to avoid, can help your clients in less obvious ways as well. The Pew Research Center&rsquo;s January 13, 2013, <em>Sandwich Generation</em> report discloses that more than 1 in every 5 middle-aged workers provide financial support to a parent. Helping your client&rsquo;s parent make the wisest Social Security choices could indirectly put dollars back into your client&rsquo;s retirement accumulation savings!</p>
  <p>There is a final benefit to Social Security that is not to be overlooked. All Social Security payments, including retirement benefits, are indexed annually for inflation through the use of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). There is comfort in the COLA for clients concerned about maintaining purchasing power.</p><h3>Social Security Financial Solvency</h3>
  <p>Will you receive your promised benefits from Social Security? This visceral worry may be on the hearts and minds of many, if not most, of your clients as they read predictions of doom and gloom in the headlines. Join us as we separate fear from fact.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Client Fear</strong></p>
    <p>Social Security will become insolvent.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
    <p>Complete insolvency is unlikely because of the very nature of Social Security. At its core, Social Security is a system of inter-generational wealth transfer through taxation. Every generation pays for the previous generation&rsquo;s benefits through payroll taxes. As long as this nation has individuals working in covered employment, there will be a source of funding for Social Security benefit payments. <strong></strong><br>
</p>
    <p>The Social Security Administration reports in its <em>Summary of the 2013 Annual Reports</em>, that until 2010, annual payroll taxes collected were more than annual benefits paid. The difference was invested in specialized Treasury bonds owned by the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund.</p>
<p>The report further asserts that since 2010, more benefits were paid annually than taxes collected. The funding for the difference comes from the Trust Fund. The report also notes that, even if the current structure is not reformed, 100% of promised benefits will be paid through 2033 and approximately 75% of promised benefits will be paid from 2034 through 2087.</p></div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>What, then, are the planning implications for your clients? There are at least three potential responses: 1) assume everything will be fixed by Congress and that 100% of expected benefits will be paid; 2) assume the worst case and no benefits will be paid; or 3) strike a middle ground by assuming most, but not all, promised benefits will be paid. While an argument could be made for choice 3, ultimately your client’s wishes will drive which of these choices is most appropriate.</p>
  <p>Our purpose in this Social Security discussion is to help raise awareness of these issues rather than to suggest specific client recommendations. Clients may present differing goals, life expectancies, income tax rates, and earnings histories. Social Security regulations and tax laws are subject to change. Hence, specific client questions should be directed to the Social Security Administration, an attorney, CPA, or CFP® professional.</p>
