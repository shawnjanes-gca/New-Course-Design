<p>The National Center for Employee Ownership reports that 36% of employees in public companies own stock through an employer stock ownership plan. While an exhaustive review of stock options is beyond the scope for this training, your understanding of stock option basics will leverage your credibility in this popular accumulation strategy.</p>
<p>The potential for income deferral from options appeals to those clients expecting a lower income tax rate in retirement. An employer stock option can be described as a contract (the grant) to sell employer stock to an employee at a specified price (the grant price) after a certain period of time (the vesting period). The employee benefits if the fair market value of the stock rises above the grant price. On the other hand, if the price of the stock goes down, the employee loses nothing.</p>
<p>Employer stock options are offered in a number of versions. Two of the most common versions are Nonqualified Stock Options (NSOs) and Incentive Stock Options (ISOs).</p>
<p>Nonqualified Stock Options (NSOs) are &ldquo;nonqualified&rdquo; because they do not qualify for the special tax incentives available through ISOs. They can be viewed simply as deferred compensation.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>As a result of law changes, NSOs now tend to be issued with a grant price equal to fair market value on the grant date. Previously, NSOs were frequently issued with a grant price below fair market value on the grant date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the options vest, the employee may exercise the option by paying the grant price and receiving the stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employer generally receives an income tax deduction to the extent the employee recognizes income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compensation income will be recognized at the exercise date to the extent that the market price exceeds the grant price. The employee is subject to income tax, Social Security tax (potentially), and Medicare tax on the income recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Gertrude was awarded 1,000 NSOs on Acme. The fair market value of Acme stock was $50 per share on the grant date and the grant price was $50 per share. The NSOs vest in 10 years.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Gertrude exercised her options 3 years after the vesting date when the fair market value of Acme was $75 per share.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She paid $50 for each share and received Acme stock worth $75 per share. Her gain was $25 per share multiplied by 1,000 shares for a total gain of $25,000. As of the exercise date, $25,000 is treated as compensation income, not capital gain.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She will pay federal ordinary income as high as 39.6% in 2016 plus state income tax, plus (potentially) Social Security plus basic Medicare. The combined tax rate could easily exceed 50%!</p>

<p>Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) offer the potential for long-term capital gains treatment as opposed to compensation income. ISOs tend to be awarded to executives rather than rank-and-file employees.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>ISOs provide the optimum income tax result when your client is not subject to the <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>Alternative Minimum Tax</strong></a>. While a detailed review of the AMT is beyond the scope of this training, please be aware of this issue. The client&rsquo;s CPA or other tax professional should be consulted before the exercise of ISOs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ISO must be issued at or above fair market value on the date of the grant. No more than $100,000 of ISOs can vest per person per year; any amount beyond $100,000 becomes NSOs. The term of the option may not exceed 10 years and the employer&rsquo;s Board of Directors must authorize the ISO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a costly yet all too common mistake to avoid. The executive must remain an employee from the date of grant to within 90 days of the exercise date. Violation of this rule causes the options to be treated as NSOs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employer receives no income tax deduction at any time in connection with ISOs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No income to the employee is recognized for regular income tax purposes at the grant date or the exercise date. Only when the shares are sold will gains be subject to taxation. The gains are taxed as long-term capital gains if certain holding period requirements are met.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Hamlet was awarded 1,000 ISOs of Acme stock. The fair market value of Acme stock was $50 per share on the grant date and the grant price was $50 per share. The ISOs vest in 10 years.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Hamlet exercised his options on the vesting date when the fair market value of Acme was $75 per share. He was not subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He paid $50 for each share and received Acme stock worth $75 per share. His gain was $25 per share multiplied by 1,000 shares for a total gain of $25,000. The gain is not taxed at the exercise date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He may defer recognition of the gain until he sells the shares. He will pay long-term capital gains tax on the gain in the year of sale.</p>

<h4>Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)</h4>
<p>The AMT system is designed to ensure all taxpayers pay at least a minimum percentage of income tax. One of the ways the AMT accomplishes this goal is by disallowing certain income exclusions for AMT purposes, such as the exclusion of gain on exercise of ISOs. The AMT, when it applies, is paid in addition to the taxpayer&rsquo;s regular income tax amount.</p>
