  <p>A small business owner may consider the SIMPLE IRA for its deferral opportunities (not available in the SEP) and relatively administrative costs when compared to qualified plans.</p>
  <p>A SIMPLE IRA is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows the employee (including self-employed individuals) to make pre-tax compensation deferrals. The employer is also required to make contributions. Once established, the SIMPLE IRA offers very appealing benefits, although it also has noteworthy restrictions. </p>

              <p>Here is a rule that your clients simply must know. If early withdrawals occur (i.e., distributions prior to age 59½) within the 2-year period following the date of the employee's first participation, the 10% IRS penalty tax is increased to 25% unless an exception applies (e.g., death, disability, etc.). Premature distribution penalties from other types of IRAs incur a smaller penalty of only 10%. The SIMPLE IRA 25% penalty may not be avoided by rolling over a SIMPLE IRA to another type of IRA within the 2-year period described above.</p>
