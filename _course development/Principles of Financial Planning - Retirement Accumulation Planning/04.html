  <p>The issues and concerns clients have regarding their retirement tend to shift as they age.  This makes it possible for us to examine retirement planning in the context of a <strong><em>retirement lifecycle</em></strong> that can be divided into two stages: pre-retirement and post-retirement.  </p>

                <p>This stage is characterized by <strong><em>asset accumulation and growth</em></strong>. For example, many clients in the pre-retirement phase will have &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; for their retirement and their concerns will revolve around issues like:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>&quot;When can I retire?&quot; or </li>
                  <li>&quot;Can I afford to live in a beach-front home when I retire?&rdquo;</li>

              <div class="p7tp3-col-wrapper no-columns">
                <p>As clients approach the actual point of retirement, their concerns begin to shift from accumulation and growth to income planning and health preservation<strong><em>.</em></strong> In other words, their focus shifts to having adequate income for their living expenses, adequate insurance to help maintain their everyday health, and adequate protection against depleting their assets due to long-term illness.</p>
                <p>As clients go through their post-retirement years, they may find that circumstances evolve in ways they had not anticipated. Their investment needs may change, as might their attitudes regarding their investments. Client life expectancies may become a factor in investing decisions. For example, a client may be well advised to consider conservative equity securities in their post-retirement portfolio to provide continued growth for a long life span in retirement.</p>
                <p>They also begin to shift their concerns to what will happen after they die and become concerned about the transfer of their estates to heirs in the most tax-effective and beneficial ways.</p>

<p>Advisors who recognize these differing needs and provide adequate solutions to the situation should thrive. On the following pages, we shall examine planning for retirement accumulation. Wise decisions during the accumulation period generally mean more income in retirement. The ideal retirement distribution plan is the natural consequence of an effective accumulation plan, launched as early as possible in a client&rsquo;s career.</p>
