<p>Traditional IRAs represent one of the vehicles intended by Congress as retirement accumulation tools. Hence, taking a taxable withdrawal from a Traditional IRA too early violates Congressional intent and may incur penalty.</p>
<p>How early is too early? A premature withdrawal is a distribution before the IRA owner&rsquo;s age 59&frac12;. Premature withdrawal of taxable income from a Traditional IRA generally exposes the taxable portion of the withdrawal to a 10% penalty. This 10% penalty is in addition to any income taxes on the amount of taxable income withdrawn.</p>
<p>But what does your client do when they need liquidity? Here are just a few penalty-free ideas to consider.</p>

<p>If there are no other sources of liquidity for your client&rsquo;s urgent need, there may be no alternative to a premature withdrawal from an IRA. However, careful planning may reduce or eliminate the 10% premature withdrawal penalty. The specific situations where an owner can make penalty-free withdrawals prior to age 59&frac12; are listed below.</p>

<h4>Cautions When Borrowing From Life Insurance Cash Value</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extreme caution is warranted to avoid collapsing the policy through excessive borrowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The life insurance company will charge interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the life insurance company does not require repayment of the loan and interest, the loan amount plus accumulated interest will reduce the death benefit paid to the client&rsquo;s beneficiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, loans are income tax-free up to the total cash value. <strong></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A life insurance professional, CPA, or CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> practitioner should be consulted before any loans are taken against the cash value of a life insurance policy.</p>

<h4>Amount Contributed to a Roth IRA</h4>
<p>A client&rsquo;s original contributions to a Roth IRA may generally be withdrawn without tax at any time. The reason is simple - the client did not receive an income tax deduction for the contribution and any withdrawal of contributions is an income tax-free return of contributions. Be aware that withdrawal of any Roth IRA funds contributed from conversion of Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may not be made for at least 5 years after the conversion. Withdrawal of converted funds before the expiration of 5 years will generally result in a 10% penalty.</p>

<h4>Substantially equal periodic payments</h4>
<p>By setting up a specific type of periodic payment based on the IRA owner's life expectancy (or joint life expectancy) that lasts for the longer of 5 years or to age 59&frac12;, it becomes possible for individuals to begin drawing upon their IRA without IRS penalty before reaching age 59&frac12;. These are sometimes referred to as <strong><em>72(t) payments</em></strong>, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code that permits this form of penalty-free payout. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer6','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for examples.</strong></p>
