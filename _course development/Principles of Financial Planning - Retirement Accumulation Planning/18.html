  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Premature Withdrawal Penalty </span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Traditional IRAs represent one of the vehicles intended by Congress as retirement accumulation tools. Hence, taking a taxable withdrawal from a Traditional IRA too early violates Congressional intent and may incur penalty.</p>
  <p>How early is too early? A premature withdrawal is a distribution before the IRA owner&rsquo;s age 59½. Premature withdrawal of taxable income from a Traditional IRA generally exposes the taxable portion of the withdrawal to a 10% penalty. This 10% penalty is in addition to any income taxes on the amount of taxable income withdrawn.</p>
  <p>But what does your client do when they need liquidity? Here are just a few penalty-free ideas to consider.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Alternatives to Taxable Traditional IRA Withdrawals Before Age 59½</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Home equity line of credit</li>
      <li>Loan from an employer-sponsored qualified plan such as a 401(k) Plan</li>
      <li>Securities-based loan such as a brokerage account loan</li>
     <li>Borrow from the cash value of a life insurance contract, subject to <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cautions When Borrowing From Life Insurance Cash Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extreme caution is warranted to avoid collapsing the policy through excessive borrowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The life insurance company will charge interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the life insurance company does not require repayment of the loan and interest, the loan amount plus accumulated interest will reduce the death benefit paid to the client's beneficiaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, loans are income tax-free up to the total cash value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A life insurance professional, CPA, or CFP® practitioner should be consulted before any loans are taken against the cash value of a life insurance policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Check with your compliance department before discussing life insurance issues with clients to avoid compliance issues!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">cautions</a>.</li>
 <li>Withdrawal of <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A client&rsquo;s original contributions to a Roth IRA may generally be withdrawn without tax at any time. The reason is simple - the client did not receive an income tax deduction for the contribution and any withdrawal of contributions is an income tax-free return of contributions. Be aware that withdrawal of any Roth IRA funds contributed from conversion of Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may not be made for at least 5 years after the conversion. Withdrawal of converted funds before the expiration of 5 years will generally result in a 10% penalty.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">amount contributed to a Roth IRA</a></li>

  <p>If there are no other sources of liquidity for your client’s urgent need, there may be no alternative to a premature withdrawal from an IRA. However, careful planning may reduce or eliminate the 10% premature withdrawal penalty. The specific situations where an owner can make penalty-free withdrawals prior to age 59½ are listed below.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Penalty-Free IRA Withdrawals Before Age 59½ </strong></p>

These are sometimes referred to as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;72(t) payments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code that permits this form of penalty-free payout.

He wishes to begin taking distributions from his Traditional IRA based upon his life expectancy.
