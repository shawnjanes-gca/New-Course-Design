  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Premature Withdrawal Penalty </span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Traditional IRAs represent one of the vehicles intended by Congress as retirement accumulation tools. Hence, taking a taxable withdrawal from a Traditional IRA too early violates Congressional intent and may incur penalty.</p>
  <p>How early is too early? A premature withdrawal is a distribution before the IRA owner&rsquo;s age 59½. Premature withdrawal of taxable income from a Traditional IRA generally exposes the taxable portion of the withdrawal to a 10% penalty. This 10% penalty is in addition to any income taxes on the amount of taxable income withdrawn.</p>
  <p>But what does your client do when they need liquidity? Here are just a few penalty-free ideas to consider.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Alternatives to Taxable Traditional IRA Withdrawals Before Age 59½</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Home equity line of credit</li>
      <li>Loan from an employer-sponsored qualified plan such as a 401(k) Plan</li>
      <li>Securities-based loan such as a brokerage account loan</li>
      <li>Borrow from the cash value of a life insurance contract, subject to cautions.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Withdrawal of <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A client&rsquo;s original contributions to a Roth IRA may generally be withdrawn without tax at any time. The reason is simple - the client did not receive an income tax deduction for the contribution and any withdrawal of contributions is an income tax-free return of contributions. Be aware that withdrawal of any Roth IRA funds contributed from conversion of Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may not be made for at least 5 years after the conversion. Withdrawal of converted funds before the expiration of 5 years will generally result in a 10% penalty.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">amount contributed to a Roth IRA</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>If there are no other sources of liquidity for your client’s urgent need, there may be no alternative to a premature withdrawal from an IRA. However, careful planning may reduce or eliminate the 10% premature withdrawal penalty. The specific situations where an owner can make penalty-free withdrawals prior to age 59½ are listed below.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Penalty-Free IRA Withdrawals Before Age 59½ </strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Death </li>
      <li>Disability <em>(the disability must be total and permanent or expected to result in death) </em></li>
      <li>A series of substantially equal periodic payments made over      the owner&rsquo;s lifetime</li>
      <li>To the extent of unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 10% of AGI </li>
      <li>To pay health insurance premiums after the owner has received unemployment compensation for more than 12 weeks </li>
      <li>To pay the costs of a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A purchaser is considered a &ldquo;first-time&rdquo; homebuyer if the purchaser has not owned a home in the past two years.

Note that the withdrawal can be used to pay qualified acquisition costs for a first-time home purchaser who is the IRA owner, the spouse, the owner or spouse&rsquo;s child, the owner or spouse&rsquo;s grandchild, or the owner or spouse&rsquo;s parent or other ancestor. &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">first-time home purchase</a> (subject to a <em>lifetime</em> limit of $10,000) </li>
