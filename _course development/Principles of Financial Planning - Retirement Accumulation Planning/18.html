    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Traditional IRAs represent one of the vehicles intended by Congress as retirement accumulation tools. Hence, taking a taxable withdrawal from a Traditional IRA too early violates Congressional intent and may incur penalty.</p>
  <p>How early is too early? A premature withdrawal is a distribution before the IRA owner&rsquo;s age 59½. Premature withdrawal of taxable income from a Traditional IRA generally exposes the taxable portion of the withdrawal to a 10% penalty. This 10% penalty is in addition to any income taxes on the amount of taxable income withdrawn.</p>
  <p>But what does your client do when they need liquidity? Here are just a few penalty-free ideas to consider.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Alternatives to Taxable Traditional IRA Withdrawals Before Age 59½</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Home equity line of credit</li>
      <li>Loan from an employer-sponsored qualified plan such as a 401(k) Plan</li>
      <li>Securities-based loan such as a brokerage account loan</li>
      <li>Borrow from the cash value of a life insurance contract, subject to cautions.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Withdrawal of amount contributed to a Roth IRA  </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  
  <p>If there are no other sources of liquidity for your client’s urgent need, there may be no alternative to a premature withdrawal from an IRA. However, careful planning may reduce or eliminate the 10% premature withdrawal penalty. The specific situations where an owner can make penalty-free withdrawals prior to age 59½ are listed below.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Penalty-Free IRA Withdrawals Before Age 59½ </strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Death </li>
      <li>Disability <em>(the disability must be total and permanent or expected to result in death) </em></li>
      <li>A series of substantially equal periodic payments made over      the owner&rsquo;s lifetime</li>
      <li>To the extent of unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 10% of AGI </li>
      <li>To pay health insurance premiums after the owner has received unemployment compensation for more than 12 weeks </li>
      <li>To pay the costs of a first-time home purchase (subject to a <em>lifetime</em> limit of $10,000) </li>
      <li>To pay for the qualified expenses of higher education for the      IRA owner and/or eligible family members </li>
      <li>In response to an IRS levy  </li>
    </ul>
