  </h1>
  <p>A high net worth, high-income prospect is in your office seeking fresh ideas to defer income into her retirement years. She&rsquo;s been singularly unimpressed with the stale advice received from her current advisor.</p>
  <p>You can show her how to <strong><em>defer hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in income</em></strong> for retirement using a &ldquo;Spigot Trust.&rdquo; The potential income tax deferral from Spigot Trust earnings is limited only by your client&rsquo;s contributions, which are not limited by law!</p>
  <p>This trust functions as an income spigot by turning income distributions off during the retirement accumulation phase and turning income distributions on during the distribution phase of retirement.</p>
  <p>The Spigot Trust is an irrevocable charitable trust technically referred to as the Net Income with Make-up Charitable Remainder UniTrust (NIMCRUT). We will refer to the NIMCRUT by its more client-friendly nickname, the Spigot Trust, in this discussion.</p><!-- Create Tooltip -->
  <p>Prospects for a Spigot Trust have typically exhausted all traditional methods of retirement accumulation and tend to place a high value upon the following:</p>

              <p>A genuine charitable intent is a virtual prerequisite for Spigot Trusts. These trusts are, at their heart, Charitable Irrevocable Trusts in which a charity will receive the assets remaining in the trust at some future event, such as the death of your client.</p>
              <p>The Spigot Trust can be impactful for accumulating income for future payment to your client. Yet, you will want to clearly communicate that the assets remaining in the trust at the termination of the trust will be lost to the family forever. However, this downside can frequently be addressed using a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Wealth &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eplacement &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;rust&lt;/em&gt; owns life insurance used to replace some of the family wealth eroded by charitable gifts. The beneficiaries of wealth replacement trusts are customarily family members of the insured.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Wealth Replacement Trust</a>.</p>

              <p>Clients or prospects with significant net worth and cash flow, especially those who have become successful late in life or who have procrastinated in retirement accumulation saving, may be attracted to the Spigot Trust&rsquo;s ability to accumulate significant amounts of supplemental retirement income. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here for an example.</span></p>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box">
                <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
                <p><strong><em>Note – There is an abundance of Spigot Trust design choices. This example denotes but one of those design choices.</em></strong></p>
                <p>Your client Allison (age 46) established a Spigot Trust in the current year by contributing $1,000,000 in highly-appreciated Coca-Cola stock to the trust.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong><em>The Trust document requires that Allison receive the lesser of current year income </em></strong><em>(defined as dividends and interest)<strong> OR 5% of trust assets </strong></em>every year until her age 65<strong><em>.</em></strong> The 5% is called the &ldquo;stated payout percentage.&rdquo;  </li>
                  <li>What happens if the income generated by the trust is less than 5% in any year? In that case, Allison receives a payout of less than 5%. To the extent Allison receives less than 5% in any year, the amount under distributed is tracked for potential payout to Allison during her retirement years.</li>
                  <li>The stated payout percentage must be selected when the trust is created, cannot be changed, and must range from a minimum of 5% to maximum of 50%.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following happens next: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The trustee may or may not choose to sell the Coca-Cola stock. Since the trust is income tax exempt, no capital gains taxes are paid by the trust if the Coca-Cola stock is sold.</li>
                  <li>From Allison&rsquo;s age 46 to age 65 (20 years), the Trust invests only in growth securities paying no dividends. The Trust invests in no interest income generating securities. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Average annual return during this period is 8%, derived 100% from growth in the market value of the portfolio. </li>
                  <li>The Trust receives no &ldquo;income&rdquo;; hence, Allison receives no payout from the Trust from her age 46 through age 65.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Spigot Trust magic starts with the following: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Because the Spigot Trust is an income tax exempt entity, the 8% annual return compounds tax-free.</li>
                  <li>By Allison&rsquo;s age 65, the market value of the trust will have grown to approximately $4.3MM.</li>
                  <li>The trustee will change the investment allocation of the trust to generate at least 5% in income annually beginning at Allison&rsquo;s age 65.</li>
                  <li>Allison, beginning at her age 65, will receive approximately $215,000 (5% of $4.3MM) annually for the rest of her life.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>But there&rsquo;s more! Remember all of those years during which Allison received no payout? </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The payout she did not receive is referred to as an under-distribution. </li>
                  <li>The under-distribution may be paid out periodically to Allison during her retirement years as a supplemental distribution <em>in addition to</em> the 5% payout percentage stated in the trust document.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Caveat</strong> - The under-distribution can only be paid out to Allison in those retirement years for which trust income (interest and dividends) exceeds the stated payout percentage of 5%. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Not all market cycles will be ideal for this strategy. Specialized investment techniques may be required for the Spigot Trust to function effectively in low interest rate market environments. </li>
                  <li>Note that the trust investment strategy must change from growth to income upon Allison&rsquo;s retirement.</li></ul></div>

  <p>The Spigot Trust, although impressive, is not retirement accumulation Utopia. The sobering disadvantages of this strategy include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spigot Trusts are irrevocable. Amounts remaining in the trust at the trust&rsquo;s termination go to charity and are lost to the family forever.</li>
    <li>Specialized investment techniques may be required for the trust to function effectively in low interest rate markets.</li>
    <li>Spigot Trust agreements are often scrutinized by the IRS, thus due diligence should be taken in drawing up the agreement.</li>
    <li>Hard-to-value assets, such as closely-held business interests, are not generally appropriate.</li>
    <li>Income distributions from the trust to the non-charitable beneficiary are generally taxed at ordinary income tax rates.</li>
