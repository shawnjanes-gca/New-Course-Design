<p>In the late Twentieth Century, the majority of investors described themselves as &ldquo;Aggressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;Growth-Oriented.&rdquo;  Growth at any cost was their mantra and their portfolios responded as you might expect in the late nineties.  Fewer investors today would describe themselves the same way, but many early to mid-career clients should consider an Aggressive Growth model because of the long-term nature of their goal.</p>
  <p>The best thing an advisor can do is to help clients analyze their previous behavior, current risk tolerances, and their investment needs relative to their goals, and then construct an asset allocation designed to meet those needs.</p>
