  <p>Is your self-employed client frustrated by the low contribution and deferral limits in qualified plans and IRAs? Surprisingly enough, a variation of the &ldquo;old-time traditional&rdquo; Defined Benefit Plan named the &ldquo;Personal Benefit Plan&rdquo; is a potential solution.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Self-employed clients may be able to save a tax deductible $150,000 or more annually using Personal Defined Benefit Plans!</em></strong></p>

  <p>Conventional wisdom would have us believe that risk-savvy employers (and their advisors) should run, not walk, away from sponsoring Defined Benefit Plans. Why? The expenses and risks chronicled on the previous pages are daunting to businesses with large numbers of employees. While conventional wisdom may be all well and good for a large corporation, such &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; may fail us when advising certain self-employed clients.</p>
  <p>Ideal candidates for the Personal Defined Benefit Plan have these characteristics:  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Self-employed with no employees</li> <!-- Create Tooltip -->
    <li>Inability to accumulate sufficient retirement accumulation savings using other accumulation vehicles such as IRAs or 401(k) Plans</li>
    <li>Consistent yearly discretionary cash flow sufficient to make required annual contributions into the plan</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Financial decisions are based upon an analysis of advantages versus disadvantages and this decision is no different. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each to learn more.</span></p>

Your client, if an owner, may be regarded as a fiduciary by plan regulators, with a fiduciary&rsquo;s legal responsibilities. An ERISA attorney should be consulted as part of the planning process.</div>
