  <ul>
    <li>Rollover opportunities may depend upon client perceptions of your qualified plan competence.</li>

    <li>Qualified plan investments should be coordinated with IRA and personal savings investment strategies.</li>
  </ul>
  Our presentation of qualified plans on the following pages is intended to build your confidence and competency without burdening you with minutiae. Let us begin with an understanding of the often-misused term &ldquo;qualified plan.&rdquo;
  <p>A qualified plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that qualifies for special tax treatment under a special section of the Internal Revenue Code. Only plans governed by this special section<sup>1</sup> are referred to as "qualified," although there are <a href="#" title="p&gt;A number of arrangements, accounts, or plans provide income tax deferral, income tax-free distribution, or deduction of contributions. These plans are not qualified plans and include Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, 403(b) plans, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">other retirement savings arrangements</a> that provide tax advantages.

      <li>They provide tax-deferred savings for retirement.</li>
      <li>They must be written programs that are communicated to all employees.</li>
      <li>They cannot be biased toward the highly compensated.</li>
      <li>Employees must be fully <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Vesting is the process by which a qualified plan participant obtains non-forfeitable rights to his or her account balance or accrued benefit attributable to employer contributions. Remember that employees are always and immediately vested in their own deferrals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vesting schedules are commonly used as an incentive for employees to stay with the employer. The employee becomes vested in employer contributions only after completing a period of employment - the plan may define the process of vesting as incremental or all at one time. Once the participant becomes fully vested, all past employer contributions are fully non-forfeitable for the participant, and all future contributions become immediately non-forfeitable.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">vested</a> within specified guidelines.</li>
      <!-- Create Tooltip -->
      <li>When employees leave, they may keep their funds in the plan if their vested account balance is greater than $5,000, they may be able to roll the assets over to the new employer's plan if the new employer's plan permits it, or they may roll the assets over into an IRA.</li>
      <li>Distributions must generally begin by April 1 of the year after the participant&rsquo;s age 70Â½.</li>
      <li>Assets held in qualified plans are protected under federal law without limit from  most creditors in the event of client bankruptcy.</li>
