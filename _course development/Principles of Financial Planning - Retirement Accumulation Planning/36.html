      <li>They must be written programs that are communicated to all employees.</li>

      <li>When employees leave, they may keep their funds in the plan if their vested account balance is greater than $5,000, they may be able to roll the assets over to the new employer's plan if the new employer's plan permits it, or they may roll the assets over into an IRA.</li>
      <li>Distributions must generally begin by April 1 of the year after the participant&rsquo;s age 70Â½.</li>
      <li>Assets held in qualified plans are protected under federal law without limit from  most creditors in the event of client bankruptcy.</li>
