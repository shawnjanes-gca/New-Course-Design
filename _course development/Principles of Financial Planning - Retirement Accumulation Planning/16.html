  <p>Anyone with <strong>taxable compensation</strong> can set up a Roth IRA. Age is not a factor for Roth IRA eligibility. Taxable compensation is also required to set up a Traditional IRA, but there is an age limit as well.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>All individuals with taxable compensation can contribute to a Traditional IRA prior to the calendar year they reach age 70½. </li>
    <li>No contributions to a Traditional IRA can be made in or after the year in which an individual reaches age 70½.</li>
  </ul>

      <p>Taxable compensation can generally be viewed as earned income. Earned income is income earned from personal services provided. Do not confuse taxable compensation with unearned income, such as stock dividends and interest. Dividends and interest are NOT forms of compensation - they are forms of investment income. IRA contributions MUST be based solely on the portion of taxable income that is received as compensation earned from personal services. But, as the following table illustrates, taxable compensation for IRA purposes includes income that is not always thought of as &ldquo;earned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is the maximum amount that can be contributed each year to Traditional and Roth IRAs? Various rules may impact an individual&rsquo;s ability to deduct contributions (for Traditional IRAs) or to make any contributions at all (for Roth IRAs).</p>
