  <p>Is your self-employed client frustrated by the low contribution and deferral limits in qualified plans and IRAs? Surprisingly enough, a variation of the &ldquo;old-time traditional&rdquo; Defined Benefit Plan named the &ldquo;Personal Benefit Plan&rdquo; is a potential solution.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Self-employed clients may be able to save a tax deductible $150,000 or more annually using Personal Defined Benefit Plans!</em></strong>
  <div id="p7SMLcontent_1" class="sml-content">
    <div id="p7SMLwrapper_1">
      <h3>$150,000 or More</h3>
      <p>The maximum annual benefit that can be paid to a participant at his or her age 65 (in 2016, as indexed) is the lesser of $210,000 or 100% of the average compensation earned over the three highest paid consecutive years. <br>
Therefore, the maximum contribution to the Personal Defined Benefit Plan is the amount required to fund the maximum annual benefit for the life of your client. </p>
Annual contribution amounts are determined by an actuary, based upon your client&rsquo;s current age, retirement age specified in the plan, compensation, income replacement formula in the plan, and investment performance. <strong>Click</strong> <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A 55-year-old client wishing to retire at age 65 with a $210,000 annual benefit for life would have to make annual (fully deductible) contributions of approximately $193,000 per year over a 10-year period. A 6% portfolio return is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">here</a> <strong>for an example.</strong>    </div>

  <p>Conventional wisdom would have us believe that risk-savvy employers (and their advisors) should run, not walk, away from sponsoring Defined Benefit Plans. Why? The expenses and risks chronicled on the previous pages are daunting to businesses with large numbers of employees. While conventional wisdom may be all well and good for a large corporation, such &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; may fail us when advising certain self-employed clients.</p>
  <p>Ideal candidates for the Personal Defined Benefit Plan have these characteristics:  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Self-employed with <a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_1" class="p7TTM_trg" title="<p>The Personal Defined Benefit Plan is fully subject to ERISA&rsquo;s employee participation rules. These rules require that a number of non-owner employees must be covered under the plan. Because plan coverage is expensive and fraught with investment risk, the ideal client has no employees or only a spouse and/or children as employee(s).</p>">no employees</a></li> <!-- Create Tooltip -->
    <li>Inability to accumulate sufficient retirement accumulation savings using other accumulation vehicles such as IRAs or 401(k) Plans</li>
    <li>Consistent yearly discretionary cash flow sufficient to make required annual contributions into the plan</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Financial decisions are based upon an analysis of advantages versus disadvantages and this decision is no different. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each to learn more.</span></p>

Your client, if an owner, may be regarded as a fiduciary by plan regulators, with a fiduciary&rsquo;s legal responsibilities.
