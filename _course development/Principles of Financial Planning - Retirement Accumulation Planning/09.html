  <p>How would your client react to a strategy that provided a guaranteed lifetime income in retirement, tax-deferred growth, and unlimited contributions during the accumulation period? An annuity can give your client all of those benefits and more. This course is centered upon accumulation planning, so an annuity that defers distributions to retirement, a deferred annuity, is our focus in the discussion that follows.</p>
  <p>An annuity is simply a contract that provides a series of periodic payments to an individual referred to as the annuitant. While a detailed analysis of annuities is beyond the scope for this course, we will summarize select characteristics of this powerful retirement accumulation tool.</p>
  <p>Annuities can be described in a number of different ways, as the following chart will demonstrate. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>An immediate annuity begins distributing annuity payments to the annuitant immediately after the annuity is purchased. In contrast, a deferred annuity begins distributions of annuity payments to the annuitant in the future.

              <p>A fixed annuity pays a fixed amount over the distribution period and a variable annuity pays a varying amount over the distribution period. A fixed annuity may not always provide inflation protection (such protection may be available at additional cost) or give the annuity owner a voice in selecting investments. A variable annuity provides the annuity owner with a choice over annuity investments and may provide an opportunity to maintain an inflation-adjusted annuity payout. In a variable annuity, the payment fluctuates up or down based upon investment performance of the annuity&rsquo;s investments.</p>

      <li>Opportunity, but not guarantee, to keep pace with inflation through a wide range of variable investment options (if investing in a variable annuity)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No income tax deduction as with contributions to a deductible Traditional IRA</li>
      <li>As with IRAs and certain employer-sponsored retirement plans, withdrawals prior to age 59Â½ may incur a 10% premature distribution penalty </li>
      <li>Annual fees and expenses tend to be higher than IRAs or brokerage accounts </li>
      <li>Restrictions on access to principal such as surrender charges for termination</li>
    </ul>
