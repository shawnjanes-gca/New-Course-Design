  <p>Your client may have at least two more concerns even after a thorough analysis points toward the conversion of a Traditional IRA (or employer-sponsored retirement plan balance) to a Roth IRA. Although these concerns may not be articulated, your client may wonder, &ldquo;What if I need cash for an emergency?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What if I change my mind after I pull the trigger on conversion?&rdquo; You may be able to address those concerns using the following insights.</p>
  <p><h3>What If I Need Cash for an Emergency?</h3></p>
  <p>Withdrawal of contributions from a Roth IRA are income tax-free. Income tax was paid at conversion and hence income tax on the converted funds will never be paid again. The key is to avoid penalty from those withdrawals. Converted funds may be withdrawn without penalty if the withdrawal is made AFTER five years from conversion. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here to learn more.</span></p>

  <p><h3>What if I Change My Mind?</h3></p>
  <p>It is possible to reverse the conversion in a process the IRS describes as &ldquo;recharacterization.&rdquo; The IRS defines recharacterization as a process that &ldquo;allows you to &lsquo;undo&rsquo; or &lsquo;reverse&rsquo; a conversion to a Roth IRA.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>However, the clock is ticking! Recharacterization of a conversion must be made no later than October 15 of the following year. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here for an example.</span> Noteworthy:  A special restriction applies to recharacterization of employer-sponsored retirement plan conversions.</p>
