    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A contribution to a Traditional IRA is always permitted for an individual meeting the age and taxable compensation requirements, but the deductibility of the contribution is subject to the &ldquo;active participant&rdquo; and &ldquo;modified AGI phase-out&rdquo; restrictions.</p>
  <p>Roth IRAs are different. Even for clients meeting the taxable compensation requirement (there is no age requirement), the ability to make a Roth IRA contribution may be reduced or eliminated based upon modified AGI. The phase-out ranges are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>If modified AGI falls below the bottom of the phase-out range, then the full Roth IRA contribution is authorized. If modified AGI exceeds the top of the phase-out range, then no contribution to a Roth IRA is possible.</p>
<p>Now let us equip you to answer the client question &ldquo;How much can I contribute if I make more than the minimum but less than the maximum?&rdquo; Clients with modified AGI within the phase-out ranges are allowed only partial Roth IRA contributions. To the extent a client&rsquo;s modified AGI encroaches into the phase-out range, a corresponding percentage of eligibility is lost.</p>

      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <p>Charlene is age 40, files as a single taxpayer and has a modified AGI of $120,750 in 2016.</p>
      <p>The phase-out for her filing status is $15,000 &ldquo;wide,&rdquo; spanning a range from $117,000 through 132,000 (2016). Charlene&rsquo;s modified AGI exceeds the bottom of the phase-out range by $3,750 ($120,750 – $117,000). Hence, her modified AGI has encroached into the phase-out range by $3,750. In percentage terms, the encroachment is $3,750/$15,000, or 25%.</p>
      <p>Because her modified AGI encroaches 25% into the phase-out range, she must reduce her contribution by 25%. The maximum Roth IRA contribution for an individual younger than age 50 in 2016 is $5,500. In Charlene&rsquo;s case, we must reduce her maximum contribution by 25%, which results in a 2016 maximum Roth IRA contribution of $4,125 (75% of $5,500).</p>

<p>There are two potential solutions if your client makes too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA - <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Deferrals into a Designated Roth account (DRA) in a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) Plan are NOT subject to the adjusted gross income phase-out rules. Just as every sword has two edges, this option slices to your client&rsquo;s advantage and disadvantage as well. There is no required beginning date for distributions from a Roth IRA; however, there is a required beginning date from DRAs in 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) Plans.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Designated Roth Accounts</a> and the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Here is how to take advantage of the rules that allow conversion of a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Your client simply makes a regular contribution to a Traditional IRA. Next, he or she immediately converts the Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Voila! Your client now has a Roth IRA. This strategy is not for all clients. Unwanted income taxes will result if your client has other Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs. Be sure to involve your client&rsquo;s CPA, CFP® professional, tax attorney, or other tax professional before this strategy is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Backdoor Roth IRA</a>.</p>
