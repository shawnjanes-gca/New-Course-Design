  <p>A contribution to a Traditional IRA is always permitted for an individual meeting the age and taxable compensation requirements, but the deductibility of the contribution is subject to the &ldquo;active participant&rdquo; and &ldquo;modified AGI phase-out&rdquo; restrictions.</p>
  <p>Roth IRAs are different. Even for clients meeting the taxable compensation requirement (there is no age requirement), the ability to make a Roth IRA contribution may be reduced or eliminated based upon modified AGI. The phase-out ranges are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>If modified AGI falls below the bottom of the phase-out range, then the full Roth IRA contribution is authorized. If modified AGI exceeds the top of the phase-out range, then no contribution to a Roth IRA is possible.</p>
<p>Now let us equip you to answer the client question &ldquo;How much can I contribute if I make more than the minimum but less than the maximum?&rdquo; Clients with modified AGI within the phase-out ranges are allowed only partial Roth IRA contributions. To the extent a client&rsquo;s modified AGI encroaches into the phase-out range, a corresponding percentage of eligibility is lost. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here for an example.</span></p>
