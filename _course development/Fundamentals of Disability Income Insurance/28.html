  <h3>For Professionals and Self-Employed With Employees and/or Partners</h3>
  <p>In addition to the needs previously discussed, the business owner or professional with employees has an additional need: addressing the risk of disability of one or more employees. A particularly difficult issue for an owner of a business or professional practice is to determine how long and how much to pay an employee in the event of the employee's disability. This situation can be particularly acute when a long-term employee is disabled and earns substantial compensation. Such needs can be addressed through Qualified Sick-Pay or Salary Continuation Plans.</p>
  <h3>Qualified Sick-Pay or Salary Continuation Plans <sup style="font-size: 8pt;">*</sup></h3>
 <p>A formal Qualified Sick-Pay Plan or Salary Continuation Plan funded by disability income policies can resolve the following potential problems and risks before they occur:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The potentially very substantial liability or benefit is assumed by an insurance company.</li>
    <li>All covered employees feel a greater sense of security.</li>
    <li>The employer is not burdened with subjective decisions regarding a disability, e.g., when does disability begin, how much to pay, when does the disability end, how to deal with recovery, relapse, or rehabilitation, etc.</li>
    <li>Employees can share in the cost of coverage.</li>
    <li>The premium cost of even a small group will likely be discounted and underwriting may be liberalized.</li>
    <li>No adverse income tax consequences will result that can occur without a Qualified Sick-Pay Plan.</li>
    <li>It provides flexibility in that the details of coverage can vary per class of employees.</li>
  </ul>

    <p><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">*</sup>It is beyond the scope of this course to provide a detailed discussion of corporate Qualified Sick-Pay and Salary Continuation Plans (two commonly used names for the same plan) that provide disability benefits to employees. However, if a plan of some type is not in place for a specified class of employees, communicated to employees, and enforceable by employees, any disability payments to employees or owner-employees of the business are not deductible to the business and taxable income to the employee.</p>
