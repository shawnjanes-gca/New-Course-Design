  <p>As a financial professional, you are often engaged to assist clients in planning for their financial security. A major component of the planning process is to evaluate risk factors and identify potential strategies to minimize the risks that threaten the attainment of financial goals. In pursuing goals that focus on the realization of financial independence, a significant risk that confronts almost all clients is the possibility of an accident or sickness that eliminates or limits the client's ability to earn an income. When measured against other financial risks in terms of potential size and likelihood, the risk of long-term disability commands well-deserved attention.</p>
  <p>In this course, we will address this risk management issue by investigating the following factors:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1" style="width:95%">
    <li><span>Define the risks of long-term disability.</span></li>
    <li><span>Discuss the options to alleviate the risks.</span></li>
    <li><span>Review and analyze the insurance options that are available to alleviate the risks.</span></li>
    <li><span>Use a 4-step process to determine the need for disability income insurance.</span></li>
    <li><span>Break the marketplace into three strategic segments based on the varied nature of risk characteristics and possible solutions.</span></li>
    <li><span>Discuss the appropriate application of disability insurance coverages by reviewing case studies.</span></li>
    <li><span>Helping clients to take actions to resolve their exposure to a substantial financial risk.</span></li>
  </ol>
