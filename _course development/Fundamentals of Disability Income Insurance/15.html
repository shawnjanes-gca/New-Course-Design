  <h3>Step 3: Calculate the amount and timing of income shortfalls in the event of a long-term disability.</h3></p>
  <p>Each client's objectives, attitudes, and resources differ, but this simple strategic process of evaluating the need and assisting the client in finding a solution is an efficient methodology in which all clients can engage and understand. The table below can assist in outlining the post-disability income need, current resources to offset the need, and an accurate picture of shortfalls that can be resolved by financial planning adjustments and disability income insurance. Note that the needs must be determined not only by amount of income needed, but also by the timing of the needs.</p>
