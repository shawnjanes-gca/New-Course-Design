  <p>As financial professionals, our clients look to us to advise them about wealth accumulation and to help them manage risks that can sabotage their goal of financial independence. These risks come in four forms:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><span>Loss of asset value, such as that of a home, car, jewelry, etc. </span></li>
    <li><span>Liability, resulting from professional malpractice or a multitude of personal acts.</span></li>
    <li><span>The risk of illness or physical impairment, which can result in substantial medical costs.</span></li>
    <li><span>Due to death or disability, the loss of the ability to earn an income for the benefit and well being of ourselves and our dependents.</span></li>
  </ol>
<p>Mortgage lenders require homeowner's coverage. State laws require auto insurance. Life insurance, which has been readily available since the mid 18th century and is relatively inexpensive, is sometimes required by lenders. However, the potential loss of our most substantial asset, our ability to earn an income, is too often overlooked. Think for a moment about the relative loss of a car vs. a lifetime of income: an orthopedic surgeon has his car stolen. At what cost? Maybe $50,000 to $75,000. An orthopedic surgeon loses his ability to perform surgery.  At what cost? The present value of future earnings for a 40-year-old orthopedic surgeon could easily exceed $12,000,000. But that's not all; when measured against most other risks that we routinely insure, the risk of long-term disability is actually greater. Note the following statistics:</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Risk of Home Fire</strong></th>
      <td>1 out of every 88 homes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Risk of</strong> <strong>Serious Auto Accident</strong></th>
      <td>1 out of every 70 autos</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Risk of Disability</strong></th>
      <td>1 out of every 8 people (at least 8 days)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><em>[According to the Society of Actuaries and the Commissioners Disability Table]</em></p>
  <p>As medical technology improves, our chances of surviving an illness or accident increase. Diseases that used to result in short-term death now often result in a period of long-term disability, after which a patient may or may not fully recover from treatment.</p>
  <p>Note in the table below the probability of disability before age 65 compared to the probability of death before age 65:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col"><strong>Age</strong></th>

  <p>A 30-year-old individual is 400% more likely to be disabled for at least 90 days before age 65 than to die before age 65.</p>
  <p>The probability of disability vs. death over the last generation has increased dramatically. Why?  Advances in medical science result in fewer people dying of heart attack, cancer, and other diseases. That is the good news. The other side to that coin is that the heart attack that would have killed someone a generation ago now may result in disability instead of death.</p>
  <p>The essence of a potential long-term disability emphasizes the reality of the following:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><span>The financial risk is real and substantial.</span></li>
    <li><span>The need for the basic necessities of life would continue while disabled. </span></li>
    <li><span>Plans for retirement, children's education, etc., would have to be put off, if not eliminated altogether. </span></li>
    <li><span>Costs would increase with inflation and may also increase due to ongoing required assisted living services or uninsured medical care costs.</span></li>
  </ol>
<p>In the next section, we will review the potential resources to replace earned income in the event of a long-term disability.</p>
