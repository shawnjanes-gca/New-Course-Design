<p>Smith and Weeks is a small law firm that specializes in litigation. Sam Smith and Wally Weeks practice as equal law partners. They have two associate attorneys who are paid $60,000 per year and three staff members who are paid an average of $36,000 per year. The two partners have variable incomes from year to year, but their net annual incomes average about $500,000. The two partners are primarily interested in disability coverage for themselves, but they recognize the benefits of providing coverages for their associates and staff.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The optimal plan of quality would be to insure all members of the firm with individual noncancellable and guaranteed renewable policies. However, the partners want to minimize cost and the turnover would cause increased administration and possibly greater underwriting difficulties as employees turn over. Therefore, the financial professional proposes the following levels of coverage to fund a Qualified Sick-Pay Plan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level 1:</strong> Add group LTD coverage with their existing group medical insurance carrier. The Elimination Period would typically be 90 or 180 days. This coverage would provide 60% of compensation up to $3,000 of monthly earnings (i.e., a maximum monthly benefit of $1,800) for all employees. They may wish to add group STD for the five employees, which would provide benefits with a shorter Elimination Period, with a Maximum Benefit Period of 90 to 180 days.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2:</strong> Purchase bar association coverage for the four attorneys for an additional monthly benefit of $1,500. This coverage is portable for the associates and provides them with up to $3,300 as a total monthly benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3:</strong> Purchase individual "noncancellable" and guaranteed renewable policies on the attorneys to the maximum that underwriters will allow, with due consideration to their personal financial statements. They will probably be able to acquire at least $10,000 of monthly benefit plus a Retirement Protection Benefit Rider. The office manager, who is paid $60,000 per year, would also receive an individual policy for $1,200 of monthly indemnity to assure full coverage at 60% of earnings.</p>

<p><strong>Three Additional Concerns of Disability Risk Management</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Depending on the nature of the practice, the partners may be interested in, and may be able to acquire, Professional Disability Overhead Expense insurance to cover some overhead expenses in the event a key partner is disabled for several months or long-term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the two partners should address the need to establish a buy-sell agreement which should address the prudence of funding a buy-out in the event of a partner's long-term disability.*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the small business will often borrow substantial sums to capitalize the start or expansion of the business. These loans often require personal guarantees for the owners, which puts their personal income and assets at risk. Disability Reducing Term Insurance can mitigate the risk of jeopardizing business and personal assets to guarantee payment of loans, salary or performance guarantees, and purchase agreements.*</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that in this case study, as opposed to Jack Driver in Case Study One, tailoring coverage to each individual is not a primary driver or objective. The employers want coverage for themselves, but they also want to provide benefits for their employees as well as "hiring" insurance companies as intermediaries to resolve a difficult situation if an employee becomes disabled.</p>
