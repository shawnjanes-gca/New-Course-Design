  </h1>
  <p>The following case study illustrates the use of a Qualified Sick Pay or Salary Continuation Plan.</p>
  <div class="example-box"><h3>Smith and Weeks</h3>
    <p>Smith and Weeks is a small law firm that specializes in litigation. Sam Smith and Wally Weeks practice as equal law partners. They have two associate attorneys who are paid $60,000 per year and three staff members who are paid an average of $36,000 per year. The two partners have variable incomes from year to year, but their net annual incomes average about $500,000. The two partners are primarily interested in disability coverage for themselves, but they recognize the benefits of providing coverages for their associates and staff.</p>
    <p>The associates seem to turn over about every two to three years. Staff turns over a little more slowly. Because of the turnover, the partners want to minimize the cost of coverage for the employees. </p>
    <p>Both partners are in their early forties. Associates and staff are all under forty. Currently all of the employees are healthy.</p>
