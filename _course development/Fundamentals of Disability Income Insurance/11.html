  <h1><span class="pagetitle">What Determines the Cost of a Disability Policy?</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The variety of contract provisions and riders available allow for tailoring of an individual disability income policy to the objectives and circumstances of a particular client. In addition to factors such as age, gender, occupation, avocations, and health status, the various provisions and riders also affect the premium. The Elimination Period and the Maximum Benefit Period (MBP) are two variable factors that significantly impact the premium charged.</p>
  <p>In the table, we have illustrated the hypothetical cost of coverage for a healthy, non-smoker, 40-year-old, male orthopedic surgeon who is purchasing a $10,000 monthly benefit. The table below illustrates the monthly premium charges for the basic coverage of a guaranteed renewable, noncancellable policy with a specialized definition of occupational disability. These numbers are for illustrative purposes only and can vary by applicant, location, policy provisions and insurance company.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">*</sup></p>

  <p>Note that a longer Elimination Period decreases the premium and a longer Maximum Benefit Period increases the premium. Popular riders such as COLA, a Residual Benefit, a Catastrophic Benefit, and a Retirement Protection Benefit would increase the premium. For example a policy with a 90-day Elimination Period and an Age 65 MBP, with a $3,840 monthly Retirement Protection Rider, 3% compounded COLA, Residual Benefit and an $8,000 monthly Catastrophic Benefit would increase the basic monthly premium of $430.00 to $780.44. The potential benefits of this particular policy paid to the surgeon could exceed $8,000,000. </p>
