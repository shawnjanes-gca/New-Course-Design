    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The primary tenet of the taxation of disability benefits can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong><em>If<strong> an individual or entity pays disability insurance premiums on an after-tax basis, any disability benefits received will be tax-exempt.</strong></em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>If a premium is paid by an employer and deducted as a business expense, any disability payments received by the employer or by the employee will be income taxable to the recipient.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">*</sup></em></strong></p>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>Disability premiums are not deductible by individuals, thus benefits would be received income tax-free. As previously mentioned, when underwriters of a Disability Income policy are considering the maximum limits of coverage, the issue limits are increased for benefits that will be taxable (e.g., corporate/employer paid) versus benefits that are paid for on an after-tax basis.</p>
  <p>Social Security Disability Income benefits are not taxable until the client meets certain thresholds of income.Â  Most affluent clients will typically have up to 85% of their SSDI treated as taxable income.</p>

    <p><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">*</sup>It is beyond the scope of this course to provide a detailed discussion of corporate Qualified Sick-Pay and Salary Continuation Plans (two commonly used names for the same plan) that provide disability benefits to employees. However, if a plan of some type is not in place for a specified class of employees, communicated to employees, and enforceable by employees, any disability payments to employees or owner-employees of the business are not deductible to the business and taxable income to the employee.</p>
