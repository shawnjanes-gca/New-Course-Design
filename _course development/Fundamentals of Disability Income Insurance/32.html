  <p>As you engage clients regarding their need for disability income insurance, you are likely to encounter objections.  Objections are part of our natural resistance to change.  However, objections can be your friends because they illuminate what stands in the way of a client making a decision.  The following are three common objections you will encounter, with guidance for responding to each. </p>

              <p>Many companies offer disability income insurance as an employee benefit. It frequently covers approximately 50%-60% of an employee's salary and is often available at no cost because the company pays all premiums. Because the premiums are paid directly by the employer, the benefits paid are fully taxable at the federal and state levels.</p>
              <p>The coverage for such group policies typically does not cover bonuses, deferred compensation, stock options or retirement plan contributions, which for many affluent clients can be a significant portion of their compensation. In addition, group LTD typically has a long elimination period.</p>

              <p>Clearly, disability income insurance provided by an employer may not offer a sufficient benefit to maintain a client's lifestyle in the event of disability. In addition, should a client change jobs, he/she typically cannot transfer the coverage. Moreover, company-sponsored policies are often more strict in their definitions of disability than individual policies and, therefore, typically issue benefits less frequently under the same circumstances.</p>

              <p>Another common misconception is that disability benefits offered by Social Security will provide clients and their families with adequate protection. For affluent clients, Social Security typically provides a small portion of income replacement and requires a waiting period of six months before income payments begin. In addition, benefits may be up to 85% income taxable.</p>
              <p>To qualify for benefits under Social Security, you must meet several very restrictive criteria. As stated on the Social Security Administration website: &quot;Social Security pays benefits to people who cannot work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death. Federal law requires this very strict definition of disability.&quot;</p>
              <p>As you can see, a client who relies on Social Security Disability Income is taking additional risk should they become disabled.</p>

              <p>Workers compensation is only available when someone is disabled on the job. If a disability is not work-related, no benefits will be paid under workers compensation. Coverage and benefits from Worker's Compensation varies widely from state to state and often only provides nominal payments that are received for a short period of time.</p>

<p>In summary, while each of these might provide some level of protection for a client, careful consideration must be made to address the realities of the scope of coverage and benefits available under these alternatives.  Especially in cases of working, affluent clients, you should engage the client on the realities of their needs and the coverages they will want to protect their financial situation.</p></div>
