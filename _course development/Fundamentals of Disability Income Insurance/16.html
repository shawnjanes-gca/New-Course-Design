  <h3>Step 4: Tailor the design of disability coverage to supplement other insurance and income-producing resources.</h3>
  <p>The process of policy design is a relatively simple process of matching the shortfall calculations to the design of the policy features. Seven key decisions regarding the design of a disability income policy are best evolved if done in a progressive order as follows.</p>

              <p>Affluent clients, who will predominantly be business owners, executives and professionals, will usually prefer coverage that allows no room for policy or premium revisions. In addition, most insurance companies offering high-quality contract provisions will only offer guaranteed renewable and noncancellable coverage to affluent/professional individuals. For the client who is less risk averse and/or is willing to allocate only minimal funds for this insurance coverage, it would be advisable to explore both types of policy options and let the client choose his or her preference.</p>

For the client who is less risk averse and/or is willing to allocate minimal funds for this insurance coverage, it would be advisable to also consider a policy with a less generous definition of total disability and probably a lower premium.

              <p>Most clients will not opt for a short-term solution to resolve a long-term risk and most advisors will not be comfortable suggesting an MBP of less than Age 65 or Lifetime. A question that can arise is whether to select a Lifetime MBP or an Age 65 MBP with a retirement protection benefit rider (RPBR). If the latter is chosen, then in the event of disability, the RPBR makes monthly contributions to a retirement trust. Theoretically, over time the trust will accumulate a substantive balance of funds that will be available for withdrawals at age 65. The key determinates in making the choice between a Lifetime MBP and an Age 65/RPBR combination are the calculation of estimated income that could be provided by the retirement benefit rider at age 65 vs. a lifetime benefit.</p>
              <p>There are several considerations when making this decision:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>This      calculation depends on the age of the client, the size of existing      retirement fund assets and the size of the retirement rider contributions.</li>
                <li>If      the client is older than typically about age 50 when the policy is issued,      a Lifetime MBP will probably not be available when a new policy is issued.      In this case, the RPBR is a substantive benefit with no alternative.</li>
                <li>When      a policy has a Lifetime MBP and the insured is disabled after about age      45, the actual Lifetime MBP past age 65 is scaled down. The amount      actually paid would be a decreased percentage of the Monthly Indemnity      depending on the actual age of disability. As the risk of disability      increases as the client approaches age 65, the Lifetime Benefit is far      less substantial than an Age 65/RPBR design.</li>
                <li>You      will also want to compare the Lifetime MBP vs. the Age 65/RPBR      combination. If COLA is included in the coverage, the Lifetime MBP will be      substantially more expensive since the lifetime benefits with COLA      increases could theoretically last well beyond age 65.</li>
                <li>The      retirement benefit rider provides a death benefit to survivors if, after a      disability, the insured dies before depleting the retirement fund assets.</li>
              </ul>
Analysis of the client's situation, risk tolerance, and objectives will allow an advisor to present the most realistic options from which the client may choose.            </div>

              <p>The long-term need for income is invariably a level amount once all resources for income are calculated, but some resources, such as Social Security benefits, group LTD, or a business buy-out, may be delayed for several months before payment begins. In these cases, a rider may need to be attached to boost the monthly indemnity in the early months of disability. Most financial professionals will encourage their clients to build emergency reserves to enable clients to self-insure shorter-term financial emergencies, but many clients will have not yet reached that level of financial security.</p>

              <p>The primary riders that most client situations will require consideration are the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cost-of Living Adjustment Rider</strong> â This rider increases benefit payments to keep pace with inflation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Residual Benefit Rider</strong> â This rider provides for partial payment of benefits, generally in proportion to loss of income due to disability. This allows an insured to return to work after a total disability on a gradual basis without losing all of his or her benefit, or typically allows an insured to receive benefits without the requirement of being totally disabled first. This benefit is particularly attractive to executives, professionals, or self-employed individuals without large self-sustaining businesses.</li>
                    <li>Retirement Protection Benefit Rider - This rider makes retirement plan contributions into a retirement trust in the event of disability. Earnings in the trust are tax-deferred and provide a death benefit to named beneficiaries of the trust if the insured dies prior to depletion of the funds as retirement income. Selection of this rider limits the Maximum Benefit Period to Age 65 (versus Lifetime). </li>
                    <li><strong>Guaranteed Insurability Options </strong>- This rider guarantees the right of the insured to purchase additional coverage in the future without medical underwriting. This will typically be attractive to younger clients who anticipate substantial future earnings increases, such as young professionals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Catastrophic Disability Benefit </strong>- This rider has a relatively low cost, but can provide substantial and welcome benefits when additional medical care and assisted living services are required. However, this coverage will last only for the life of the policy (typically to age 65). In the event of a claim, benefits will be paid until the Maximum Benefit Period expires, or age 65, whichever is sooner. Consideration of this risk is an excellent entre to discuss Long-term Care insurance that would provide a guaranteed renewable <em>lifetime</em> of coverage to mitigate a substantial risk that is more likely to occur past age 65.</li>
