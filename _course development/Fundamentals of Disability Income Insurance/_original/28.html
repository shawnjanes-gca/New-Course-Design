<p>In addition to the needs previously discussed, the business owner or professional with employees has an additional need: addressing the risk of disability of one or more employees. A particularly difficult issue for an owner of a business or professional practice is to determine how long and how much to pay an employee in the event of the employee's disability. This situation can be particularly acute when a long-term employee is disabled and earns substantial compensation. Such needs can be addressed through Qualified Sick-Pay or Salary Continuation Plans.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Qualified Sick-Pay or Salary Continuation Plans*</h4>
<p>A formal Qualified Sick-Pay Plan or Salary Continuation Plan funded by disability income policies can resolve the following potential problems and risks before they occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The potentially very substantial liability or benefit is assumed by an insurance company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All covered employees feel a greater sense of security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employer is not burdened with subjective decisions regarding a disability, e.g., when does disability begin, how much to pay, when does the disability end, how to deal with recovery, relapse, or rehabilitation, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees can share in the cost of coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The premium cost of even a small group will likely be discounted and underwriting may be liberalized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No adverse income tax consequences will result that can occur without a Qualified Sick-Pay Plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It provides flexibility in that the details of coverage can vary per class of employees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="style4" align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style4" align="right">*It is beyond the scope of this course to provide a detailed discussion of corporate Qualified Sick-Pay and Salary Continuation Plans (two commonly used names for the same plan) that provide disability benefits to employees. However, if a plan of some type is not in place for a specified class of employees, communicated to employees, and enforceable by employees, any disability payments to employees or owner-employees of the business are not deductible to the business and taxable income to the employee.</p>
