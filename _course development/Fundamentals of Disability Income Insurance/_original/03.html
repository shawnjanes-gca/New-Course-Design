<p>Most options to replace lost income due to disability are contingent or limited. In order to make credible suggestions to a client regarding a disability income insurance need, you must be able to identify all potential resources available to the client that will mitigate the risk of long-term disability. We have summarized below the typically available public assistance resources that are available to the affluent client. On the next page, we discuss private resources that may also be available.</p>

<div id="p7ABc2_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>SSDI benefits are intended to provide a basic income benefit (possibly taxable) to lower and middle income workers with "severe" long-term disabilities. At a minimum, for a state agency that administers the system to consider a disability claim, the claimant's "medical condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work activities - such as walking, sitting and remembering - for at least one year." Benefits could begin after five months of disability. If you cannot do the work you did in the past, the state agency looks to see if you would be able to do other work. It evaluates your medical condition, your age, education, past work experience and any skills you may have that could be used to do other work. If you cannot do other work, the state agency will decide that you are disabled. If you can do other work, the state agency will decide that you are not disabled." (Source: www.socialsecurity.gov)</p>
<p>The average SSDI benefit for a disabled worker in 2013 was approximately $1,100. The disabled worker with a spouse and at least one dependent child received an average monthly disability benefit of approximately $1,850.</p>
<p>As you can see, the potential SSDI benefits are at best modest and would not be available to a typical affluent client who may be unable to perform the normal duties of his or her profession or occupation and has lost his or her livelihood.</p>

<p>Workers' Compensation benefits are also designed primarily to cover the needs of lower and middle income workers. Benefits vary by state and coordinate with Social Security benefits. Eligibility starts with only job-related accidents or sickness. Relatively low maximum benefits apply. This is a very unlikely benefit resource for an affluent client.</p>

<div id="p7ABw2_3">
<div id="p7ABc2_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Five states (CA, NY, NJ, TX and HI) provide disability benefits when Workers' Compensation does not apply. Benefits vary by state but normally coordinate with Social Security benefits, which essentially negate SSDI benefits after five months. This potential benefit is, at best, very limited for an affluent client with a long-term disability if the client happens to live in one of the five states providing the insurance.</p>
