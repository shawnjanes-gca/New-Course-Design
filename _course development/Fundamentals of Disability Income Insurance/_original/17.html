<h2>The Disability Income Marketplace - Three Market Segments</h2>
</blockquote>
</td>

<blockquote>
<p>Disability risk management issues for various clients can vary widely due to their individual financial profiles, health status, personalities, family situations, and occupations. To accelerate your understanding of their most prominent risk management issues, however, you can easily segregate your prospects and clients into three market segments.</p>
<p>These segments are helpful because the disability risk issues of each segment are consistent but substantively different. On the following pages, we will examine how to address the needs of these segments with a series of case studies.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>When working with a client who is employed by any organization where the client has no or very little ownership interest, the client's risk management issues are limited to personal and family concerns versus financial responsibilities to employees, business partners, or creditors. The employee will rely on possible employee benefits, government programs, personal resources, and disability income insurance to resolve his or her risk of long-term disability.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Professionals and Self-employed Without Employees or Partner</strong></a></h3>

<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The concerns and needs of this second group are identical to the first group of employees with one exception. While the "solo-self-employed" individual is also focused on earned income replacement in the event of long-term disability, this group must also consider business overhead expenses that will continue for some period of time after a disability begins. In addition, liabilities may need to be paid off that pertain to the establishment or expansion of the business or practice.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Like the first and second group, the business owner must address the issue of income replacement in the event of their own disability. In addition, if the owner is a major factor in maintaining business revenue, the risk of continuing business overhead may be an expense that needs to be addressed and the owner may be personally liable for business liabilities.</p>
<p>A particularly difficult issue for an owner of a business or professional practice is to determine how long and how much to pay an employee in the event of the employee's disability. A business owner or professional may also need to address issues of business continuation and succession in the event of a long-term disability of a substantial and active owner. It may be beneficial to all parties concerned to establish <em>and fund</em> a buy sell agreement that is triggered by one of the "Four D's" - Death, Disability, Divorce or Departure.</p>
