<p><strong>The Story of Jack Driver</strong></p>
<p>Jack Driver is the general manager of a large automobile dealership in Atlanta. He has been with this particular national company for three years. Jack periodically receives offers to manage other dealerships for other companies, but has not yet been tempted to make an employer change.</p>
<p>Jack is 39, married, and has two children in a private junior high school. Jack's wife, Dana, is a full-time homemaker.</p>
<p>Jack has a base salary of $150,000, earned a performance bonus of about $100,000 last year, and expects the bonus to continue or increase in the future. His employer consistently contributes about $25,000 per year to his profit-sharing plan. The company provides family medical insurance, a medical reimbursement plan, and a Sick Pay Plan that provides Jack with one month of full salary per year of employment.</p>
<p>A group long-term disability (LTD) plan is in place that provides up to a 60% replacement of salary up to a maximum salary of $10,000 (or $6,000 benefit) per month. The company pays the entire LTD premium, which provides an occupational definition of disability for 24 months, then an "education, training and experience" definition thereafter to age 65. The Waiting Period is 180 days.</p>
<p>Jack is in very good health but has a family history of disabling diabetes and heart conditions. You have capably helped Jack with his small investment portfolio and life insurance in the past. He is concerned about his disability risk, but is confused about how to determine the amount of additional disability income coverage he can and should acquire. He has asked you to assist him in evaluating this conundrum.</p>
<p>Jack's financial condition is good. He owns his home with a mortgage; he owns one car with a small car loan, and has a small amount of credit card debt. He has a cash reserve of $10,000 in a Money Market account and a small mutual fund portfolio with a market value of $30,000, to which he contributes $500 per month. He is also contributing $500 per month into two 529 plans for his sons' college expenses. You discuss Jack's family living expenses and agree that he needs about $11,000 per month to meet his current obligations.</p>
