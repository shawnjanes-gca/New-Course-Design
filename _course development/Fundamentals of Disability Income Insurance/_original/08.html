</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This rider provides for benefit payments if a sickness or accident causes at least a partial loss of income but the insured does not qualify for total disability. This rider may also be applicable to incent or allow an insured to return to work on a gradual basis after a period of total disability and still receive benefits. On the other hand, an insured may have an illness which is progressive and allows an insured to slow down his or her working time and thus begin to receive benefits prior to a total disability.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This optional benefit will increase benefit payments after one year of disability in accordance with a predetermined formula by tying the increases to an inflation index. The annual changes may be scheduled (e.g., 5% per year), or have a maximum annual increase as well as a cumulative maximum increase. Increases may be simple or compounded. Note that the benefit increases from this rider are applied only after a claim is incurred; the age of the policy has no bearing on the annual "COLA" increases.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This optional benefit can provide extra payments beyond income replacement benefits if it is determined that the disabled insured cannot perform at least two activities of daily living (ADLs) without assistance as a result of an accident or sickness. ADLs typically include bathing, toileting, transferring, maintaining continence, and eating. This additional benefit reflects the fact that in some cases a long-term disability may actually <em>increase</em> an insured's monthly expenses.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In the event of total disability, this rider makes monthly contributions into a self-directed trust that are intended to replace contributions that would have been made by the insured and/or employer to retirement plans. This rider invariably has an Elimination Period of a minimum of 180 days and typically would be issued with a Maximum Benefit Period of no longer than age 65.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In some cases, a client may purchase an additional amount of monthly indemnity in the early months of disability. For example, John wants coverage that provides him with a monthly benefit of $10,000 to age 65 after a 60-day Elimination Period. His group LTD provides a monthly benefit until age 65 of $6,000 after a 180-day Elimination Period. John could purchase a policy with a long-term benefit of $4,000, but with an additional AMBR or $6,000 from the 60th to the 180th day. Thus, John would have a level benefit amount of $10,000 per month by "tailoring" the individual policy around his group LTD coverage.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_6" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This optional benefit coordinates benefit payments with various government disability programs; that is, if Workmen's Compensation, state disability programs, or Social Security programs do not provide benefits within the limits of the government disability program, the rider will pay. This rider can assure equivalent payments of government programs at a premium that is discounted from non-offset coverage.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_7" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This policy provision provides the opportunity to purchase additional insurance at specified future dates (usually until about age 45 or 50) without evidence of insurability. This can be an effective policy provision for someone who is potentially going to see increases in his or her overall compensation and also wants protection against future potential uninsurability.</p>

<p>The premium payer of an individual disability income insurance policy will typically either be paid with after-tax income by the insured or possibly by the insured's employer. When considering this coverage, the tax impact of benefits must be considered because, if benefits are taxed, it reduces the spending value of benefit payments and should thus be considered in determining amount of benefit needed. Note that insurance companies will typically underwrite more coverage for a particular individual if the benefits will be taxable than if the benefits would be received tax-free. On the next page, we will discuss the taxation of disability income benefits.</p>
