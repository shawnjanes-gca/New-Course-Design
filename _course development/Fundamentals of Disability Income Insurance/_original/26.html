<p><strong>Joplin's Story</strong></p>
<p>You have been discussing the need for income replacement insurance with Joplin Janice, MD, a psychiatrist who has been in private practice for 20 years. She is 45, unmarried, and has no children.</p>
<p>You have determined that she has adequate income replacement disability insurance. You also know that she shares an office with five other therapists who all operate as separate practices, but they have a written office-sharing agreement. Upon review of the agreement, you realize that Dr. Janice has an obligation for her share of the office overhead (about $3,000 per month) in the event of a short-term or long-term disability. For a long-term or permanent disability, she retains the obligation until her office can be filled with another therapist or for twelve months, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>She also has some business expenses outside of the office-sharing arrangement, including an automobile lease which she uses to commute daily to visit patients at various hospitals.</p>
<p>Dr. Janice is concerned about these potential expenses, which she would not want to pay out of her personal funds or from her income replacement insurance if she were to become disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The solution is straightforward. She decides to purchase a Professional Overhead Disability Expense policy with a maximum monthly benefit of $3,500, a 30-day Elimination Period, and a Maximum Benefit Period of 12 months. The premiums are deductible as a business expense and the benefits are taxable income (that will be offset by deductible expenses). Dr. Janice believes that if she were permanently disabled, her office space would be leased by another professional within 12 months. She believes that some of her expenses could be trimmed after a few months, and that the excess benefits could be applied to her car lease and any other incidental expenses, including professional assistance in transferring her patients.</p>
<p>Dr. Janice is delighted to refer you to the other four therapists in her office since it is in their mutual interest to have the office overhead liabilities insured in the event of disability. Dr. Janice also agrees that she would like additional life insurance to make sure that these types of liabilities are also covered in the event of her death prior to retirement.</p>
