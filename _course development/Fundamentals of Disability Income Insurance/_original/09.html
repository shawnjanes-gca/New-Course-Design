<p>Disability premiums are not deductible by individuals, thus benefits would be received income tax-free. As previously mentioned, when underwriters of a Disability Income policy are considering the maximum limits of coverage, the issue limits are increased for benefits that will be taxable (e.g., corporate/employer paid) versus benefits that are paid for on an after-tax basis.</p>
<p>Social Security Disability Income benefits are not taxable until the client meets certain thresholds of income. Most affluent clients will typically have up to 85% of their SSDI treated as taxable income.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="style5">*It is beyond the scope of this course to provide a detailed discussion of corporate Qualified Sick-Pay and Salary Continuation Plans (two commonly used names for the same plan) that provide disability benefits to employees. However, if a plan of some type is not in place for a specified class of employees, communicated to employees, and enforceable by employees, any disability payments to employees or owner-employees of the business are not deductible to the business and taxable income to the employee.</p>
