You can offer substantive assistance to help the client determine the extent of the qualitative and quantitative value of these resources.</p>

              <p>An employer may provide &quot;Sick Pay&quot; or &quot;Salary Continuation&quot; benefits to employees in the event of short and/or long-term disabilities. The conditions and potential benefits from these plans can vary dramatically. Beware of the &quot;plans&quot; that are informal and unfunded. Self-insured plans will naturally be dependent on the financial stability of the employer company. Informal/unwritten plans provide only &quot;subjective&quot; guarantees.</p>
              <p>Many plans may allow accrual of paid sick leave days based on the employee's length of service and are subtracted from accumulated days when used. Some employers will provide group short-term and/or long-term disability insurance that is either paid for, or partially paid for, by the employer. Benefits may or may not be taxable (we will discuss taxation of disability benefits later in the course).</p>
              <p>Short-term group disability will typically pay benefits for 13 to 26 weeks. These plans may not Â cover executives and higher-paid employees.</p>
              <p>Group long-term disability insurance (Group LTD) usually offers income benefits for as long as the disability lasts, or until age 65, whichever is sooner. The coverage usually begins accruing income benefits after a Waiting Period of 90 or 180 days. This coverage can provide relatively good protection for executives and should not be ignored as a viable risk management tool in the financial planning of a client.</p>
              <p>However, when compared to a quality individual disability income contract, the group LTD has certain limitations and the opportunity to supplement the group LTD should be addressed.</p>
              <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Limitations of group LTD include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The group coverage usually provides monthly benefits up to about 60% of <em>salary</em> only (not bonuses, deferred compensation, stock options, qualified plan contributions, etc.). This often results in a very low-income replacement ratio of pre-disability earnings. </li>
                      <li>Benefits may be reduced by Social Security, state disability plans, and other employer-provided disability benefits, including pension benefits paid in the event of disability. <strong>Note that if pension assets are used to pay for &quot;early retirement&quot; due to disability, the ultimate pension retirement benefit has been sacrificed.</strong></li>
                      <li>Group LTD may or may not be payable for non-occupational disabilities, or benefits may be reduced by workmen's compensation payments.</li>
                      <li>Premiums are not guaranteed and the carrier can cancel the coverage. The employer may terminate the coverage.</li>
                      <li>Group LTD is typically not portable. If an employee changes employers, the coverage cannot be continued. </li>
                      <li>This coverage may also be terminated after recovery from an extended disability and if the employee does not return to the same employer that retains the same coverage.</li>
                      <li>A group LTD plan may contain a pre-existing condition clause that lasts from 12 to 24 months after enrollment. </li>
                      <li>The definitions and provisions of group LTD are generally more restrictive when compared to a quality individual disability income contract.              </li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <!-- example-box -->
              <p>It is possible to replace the group coverage with an individual contract. However, if the premiums are paid by the employer and the quality of the group coverage is good, most clients will resist and it is difficult to replace free coverage unless it is of a poor quality.</p>

              <p>Accumulating enough financial resources to render earned income optional is a goal of virtually every client. Realistically, only a tiny segment of affluent clients are in a position to rely on their investment capital to replace their earned income during a long-term disability, especially after inflation. All financial professionals will encourage clients to first establish an &quot;emergency fund&quot; which would weather the blow of a short-term disability, as well as maintaining a plan to accumulate long-term retirement capital.</p>
