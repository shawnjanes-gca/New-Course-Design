  </h1>
  <p>Calculating the amount of disability insurance needed is a process similar to the calculation performed in determining life insurance need. There are four steps:</p>
  <h3>Step 1: Determine the need for post-disability income</h3>
  <p>Determine the amount of income that is required for family support and any potential post-disability expenses. Help your client to realistically address the complete financial impact of a long-term disability, including the loss of current earned income, inflation's impact on future expenses, potential of increased medical care, and loss or decrease of retirement benefits. A table, such as the one below, can assist you and your client to determine their post-disability income needs.</p>
