  <h3>Step 1: Determine the Need for Post-Disability Income</h3>
  <p>In this case, you and Jack have calculated a need of $11,000 per month for living expenses. You note that the disability insurance underwriters will typically offer coverage of up to 60% - 65% of pre-disability earnings, thus $11,000 per month of total coverage is within underwriting issue limits. </p>
  <p>He is also concerned about replacement of contributions to his retirement plan that he had not considered until you brought it up. The table below summarizes these income needs.</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">

        <th scope="col"><strong>$   2,100   </strong></th>
    </tr>
      <tr>

        <th scope="col"><strong><em>$   13,100</em></strong></th>
      </tr>
  </table>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If Jack's disability required care and assistance beyond medical treatment, his income replacement coverage may be somewhat or substantially depleted by custodial/long-term care expenses. We will address this issue in Step 4.</p>
