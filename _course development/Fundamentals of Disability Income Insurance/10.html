  <p>It is important to manage client expectations in regard to the outcome of underwriting; that is, what coverage is issued versus what is applied for. A greater understanding of the underwriting process enhances confidence and improves operational efficiency.</p>

                <p>Life insurance underwriting is based on substantial statistics accumulated over many decades, or even centuries. Life insurance underwriting is almost a pure science. Life insurance insures a risk that is certain to happen; it's just a question of when. </p>
                <p>The claim department rarely must make subjective decisions regarding whether or not an insured is deceased.</p>

                <p>In contrast, Disability is only a statistical probability and more subjectively evaluated both at the time of underwriting and in the event of a claim.  Disability insurance underwriting is, therefore, more complex. For example, the insurance companies typically want verification of income, probably by reviewing copies of IRS Tax Form 1040. In addition, relatively minor health or lifestyle issues may have little or no increased mortality risk but may affect morbidity (disability) risk.</p>
                <p>Note the following statistics regarding historical disability insurance versus life insurance underwriting results:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Disability income insurance applications have a 5      - 10% rejection rate (vs. 3% for life insurance).</li>
                  <li>15 - 25% of disability income insurance      applications require extra premiums and/or exclusions (vs. 3 - 5% for life      insurance). Underwriting also results in additional modifications in 15%      of disability applications.  </li>
                  <li>Net Result Comparison: 8% of life applications      are rejected or modified; 40% of disability income insurance applications      are rejected or modified. </li>
                </ul>
