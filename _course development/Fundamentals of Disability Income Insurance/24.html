  <p>It is important to remind Jack that this coverage cannot be cancelled by the insurance company prior to age 65, even if he has claims; nor can the premiums be increased. He owns the policy, thus it can be maintained even if he changes employers. In the event of a permanent disability, the potential benefits could be several million dollars.</p>
  <p>Remember that you are assisting clients in identifying a substantial financial risk and assisting them in determining how to efficiently and effectively protect themselves and dependents against the risk. It is important that you use numbers and assumptions that the clients agree to.</p>
  <p>This analysis in the hypothetical case of Jack Driver may seem a bit tedious, but there are three primary reasons why a study of this analysis is important.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, by reviewing a detailed analysis, you &quot;experience&quot; the reality of what the nature, characteristics, and reasons for an income shortfall would be in a typical situation of a long-term disability. It should create a sense of confidence and conviction when discussing the need to insure this potentially very substantial financial risk. </li>
    <li>Also, it may be helpful to use these or similar worksheets when evaluating a potential need. </li>
    <li>Finally, a client may often have a very difficult time evaluating the amount of risk he or she faces unless presented with a graphic summary using agreed upon numbers. This assists the client in making a decision to insure with confidence and conviction.</li>
  </ul>
