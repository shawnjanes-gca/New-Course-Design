<h4>Step 4: Tailor the design of disability coverage to supplement other insurance and income-producing resources.</h4>
<p>As previously discussed, we now begin addressing the policy design by progressively addressing the seven key decisions.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>For reasons previously discussed, Jack will likely prefer coverage that allows no room for policy or premium revisions. However, both options should be considered, allowing Jack to choose.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>As previously discussed, Jack will probably prefer "Own Occ", but other options should probably be considered to give him a choice of assuming more risk with lower premiums.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>As noted in Step 3, Jack has a long-term need of $8,000 per month.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_4" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>4. Length of Elimination Period</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In Step 3, Jack has a need for modest income with accumulative total of $8,300 in the first three months. However, he has a cash reserve that would easily handle the shortfall, and a 90-day elimination period (EP) would result in a substantial reduction of premium compared to a 30-day EP. Jack will most likely select a 90-day EP when his Sick Pay Plan benefits stop.</p>

<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_5" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>5. Length of Maximum Benefit Period.</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>As mentioned earlier, this is a subjective decision of clients based on their level of risk tolerance, willingness to pay premiums, age, and financial planning priorities. Most likely, Jack will select an MBP of Lifetime or Age 65. If he selects Age 65, consideration should be given to a retirement protection benefit rider. Most financial professionals would be uncomfortable suggesting consideration of insurance coverage that runs out before the client does. The financial professional is wise to show a range of realistic options to a client and let the client decide with complete disclosure of pros and cons of each option.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_6" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>6. Need for Additional Monthly Benefits in Early Months?</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_6">
<div id="p7ABc1_6" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Since we believe the sixth month's Social Security benefit is very contingent and probably taxable, we assume that Jack will need an additional monthly benefit of $5,100 in months 4, 5 and 6. The Additional Monthly Benefit Rider can be designed to provide this extra monthly indemnity for the specified three-month period.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_7" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>7. Selection of Various Riders that Suit the Profile and Objectives of the Particular Client.</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_7">
<div id="p7ABc1_7" class="p7ABcontent">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-of-Living Adjustment Rider</strong> - Certainly inflation can significantly decrease the value of benefits over a period of time; thus, Jack may want to consider a rider that increases benefit payments to keep pace with inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Residual Benefit Rider</strong> - As a business manager, Jack is likely to be interested in the ability to gradually return to work, after a full disability, without totally losing benefits once he resumes work. Jack should be offered this benefit and may very well decide to include this rider in his coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guaranteed Insurability Options </strong>- This rider guarantees the right of the insured to purchase additional coverage in the future without medical underwriting. This should be an attractive benefit to Jack since his income and living expenses are likely to increase in the future and, if he should change of employment, employer-provided disability coverage is uncertain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retirement Protection Benefit Rider (RPBR)</strong> - Consideration of this rider would typically be a choice between this rider and a Lifetime Maximum Benefit Period, which could involve a good deal of number crunching, evaluating nuances of policy provisions by different carriers and the specific characteristics of a particular client. The financial professional will develop his or her own perspective of the advantages and disadvantages of using this rider or the Lifetime MBP over a period of study and experience. In addition, many students of this course may rely on Disability Income Insurance specialists in their organization to assist in making these policy design decisions to present to a client. Earlier in the course, we discussed the advantages, disadvantages and considerations of using the RPBR versus a lifetime MBP. In the links below, we have summarized the advantages and disadvantages of the Lifetime MBP vs. the RPBR.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Catastrophic Disability Benefit </strong>- As we stated previously, this coverage will last only for the life of the policy (typically to age 65). In the event of a claim, benefits will be paid until the Maximum Benefit Period expires, or age 65, whichever is sooner. Consideration of this risk is an excellent entree to discuss Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) which would provide a guaranteed renewable <em>lifetime</em> of coverage to mitigate a substantial risk that is more likely to occur past age 65. At Jack's age, LTCI is relatively inexpensive and provides coverage both before and after retirement.</p>
