                    <li>Since LTD plan pricing is based on the insurer&rsquo;s experience with claims, costs can vary significantly from year to year. Multi-life plans funded with individual noncancellable and guaranteed renewable contracts have predictable/guaranteed costs.</li>
                    <li>Executives are more willing to participate in the cost of a plan that is of optimal quality, substantially discounted, easy to acquire, and portable.</li>
                    <li> The employer is not burdened with subjective decisions regarding a disability, e.g., when does disability begin, how much to pay, when does the disability end, how to deal with recovery, relapse, or rehabilitation, etc.            </li>
