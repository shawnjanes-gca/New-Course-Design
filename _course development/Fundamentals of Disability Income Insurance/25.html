  <h3>For Professionals and Self-employed Without Employees or Partners</h3>
  <p>Professionals such as physicians, attorneys, etc. are typically in an employee capacity, part of a professional practice that they own part or all of, or they may work alone with part-time or high-turnover employees. Likewise, many individuals own small businesses or work on a contract basis and have no employees.</p>
  <p>The concerns and needs, as well as the solutions, of this second group are identical to the first group of employees with one exception – they must also consider business overhead expenses that will continue for some period of time after a disability begins. Even a short-term disability that lasts only a few months can be financially devastating to a small business that relies on the professional or owner to generate revenue to cover overhead as well as income. </p>
