<blockquote>
<p>In many cases, a young professional or business owner may have incurred debt to purchase, establish, or expand a business or professional practice. A long-term disability would not eliminate the debt that the disabled borrower would be unable to repay without earned income, thus putting both business and personal assets at risk. In addition, some lenders may require life and disability coverage to insure the debt and/or may offer better terms if the debt is secured by life and disability insurance.</p>
<p>The following case study illustrates such a need and introduces a potential solution.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study Three - Disability Reducing Term Insurance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones' Needs</strong></p>
<p>Sam Jones, DMD, has worked in the office of Jim Baker, DMD, for two years. Dr. Baker has decided to retire and Dr. Jones wishes to purchase the practice. They agree on a price of $250,000. Dr. Jones finds a lender who will loan him $250,000 with terms of 9% payable in monthly installments over ten years. While he can afford to make these payments, Dr. Jones, as well as his creditor, is concerned about how to cover this liability in the event of his disability or death prior to the repayment of the loan.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>A "disability reducing term insurance" policy is designed specifically to make a needed level of loan payments for up to the life of the loan in the event of a borrower's long-term disability. The policy's benefit payments are assigned to the lender. In this case, Dr. Jones could also purchase a $250,000 term life insurance policy that is assigned to the creditor for the loan balance. The assigned insurance coverages reduce the risk to the lender and to Dr. Jones. In addition, the lender may reduce the interest rate on the loan. The lower interest rate may more than cover the cost of the insurance.</p>

<p><strong>A Note about Working with Young Professionals</strong></p>
<p>Many young professionals, including physicians, dentists, attorneys, CPAs, veterinarians, etc., will have minimal income but a substantial potential for earning future income. Many insurance companies will issue coverage to individuals, ranging from professional students to first-year working professionals, regardless of their current earned income level. Monthly indemnity benefits may range from $1,000 to $4,500 per month, depending on profession and professional status. In addition, step-rated or graded premiums may allow a young professional to acquire substantial coverage at very low initial rates and "lock-in" guaranteed rates at a young and often "healthy" rate.</p>
<p>A financial professional may do a young professional a significant service by assisting him or her in acquiring this coverage at a young age. This will also allow the financial professional to establish a long-term relationship with a client who has substantial future potential for wealth management services.</p>
