  <p>The definition of disability is the key ingredient in the value of a disability income contract. A <em>life insurance</em> claim is typically not debatable. However, a disability claim's &quot;validity&quot; can be much more subjective. The difference between substantial benefits paid and no benefits paid at all on a submitted disability claim can be determined solely by the contract's <em>definition</em> of disability. A neurosurgeon who develops a tremor in his hands can no longer perform surgery and may suffer a substantial loss of income. On the other hand, the same tremor in the hands of a CEO may be an annoyance, but will not threaten her abilities to perform all of the material and substantial duties of her occupation.</p>

                <p>We classify common disability definitions in disability income policies as one of four types, which are summarized below.</p>

                <p>An occupational definition is usually worded to state that benefits are provided &quot;if you cannot perform the duties or &lsquo;material and substantial duties&rsquo; of your occupation.&quot;  This definition is frequently referred to as an &ldquo;Own Occupation&rdquo; standard and represents the most favorable definition for the insured. Such policies generally require relatively high premiums as well.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the definition may also note that &quot;occupation&quot; can mean a professional's unique specialty such as neurosurgeon, or orthodontist, etc. This may mean that the claim will be payable even if the insured changes careers and earns a substantial income in a new occupation.</p>
                <p>In other cases, the occupational definition may only apply for a limited period such as 24 to 60 months of disability. After the duration of the occupational definition ends, the definition may change to one of the three that follow.</p>
                <p>Some occupations do not qualify for an occupational definition and some insureds would not consider an occupational definition worth the extra premium.</p>

              <div class="p7tp3-col-wrapper no-columns">
                <p>This definition typically states that the insured is disabled &quot;…if due to an accident or sickness you are unable to perform the duties of your occupation for which you are reasonably fit by education, training, and experience,&quot; and possibly might add &quot;with due regard to prior economic status.&quot;  This definition may also be referred to as the &ldquo;Reasonably Suited&rdquo; standard. Premium costs are generally considered moderate. </p>
                <p>This is a good definition from the standpoint of the insured, but is not as liberal as the &quot;Own Occupation&rdquo; definition.</p>

                <p>This is a simpler and considerably less liberal definition than the two above. In this case, disability is defined as something like &quot;…unable to perform the duties of any gainful employment.&quot; </p>
                <p>This definition is not common and would be used in policies that apply to higher risk classifications. This type of coverage would not typically be applied to affluent clients. </p>
<p>This definition is frequently described as the &ldquo;Any Occupation&rdquo; standard and closely mirrors the Social Security definition of disability - it is the least favorable to the insured.  Premiums tend to be the least expensive among the definitions of disability.</p>

              <div class="p7tp3-col-wrapper no-columns">
                <p>This type of definition can used to apply to a policy itself as the primary disability definition or as a supplemental rider to a policy with a total disability definition. </p>
                <p>A residual definition states that the policy will pay benefits in proportion to loss of income attributable to an accident or sickness. If used as a primary definition of disability, this type of disability will provide coverage at a lower premium than a policy with an occupational or gainfully employed definition, and may appeal to certain affluent clients.</p>
                <p>As a rider, it supplements a total disability definition with a provision for a partial loss of income.</p>

  <p>What if your client desires the most favorable definition of disability but lacks the cash flow to fund the relatively high premiums?  A &ldquo;split-definition&rdquo; policy may be the solution. For example, a policy may cover &ldquo;own occupation&rdquo; for five years after the onset of disability and then convert (or split) to a &ldquo;reasonably suited&rdquo; definition. The advantages of such an approach are to reduce premiums and provide the insured with enough time to find suitable employment.</p>
