<p>The definition of disability is the key ingredient in the value of a disability income contract. A <em>life insurance</em> claim is typically not debatable. However, a disability claim's "validity" can be much more subjective. The difference between substantial benefits paid and no benefits paid at all on a submitted disability claim can be determined solely by the contract's <em>definition</em> of disability. A neurosurgeon who develops a tremor in his hands can no longer perform surgery and may suffer a substantial loss of income. On the other hand, the same tremor in the hands of a CEO may be an annoyance, but will not threaten her abilities to perform all of the material and substantial duties of her occupation.</p>

<p>We classify common disability definitions in disability income policies as one of four types, which are summarized below.</p>
<p><span class="style4"><strong>Click each heading on the left learn more</strong><strong>.</strong></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_2" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>An occupational definition is usually worded to state that benefits are provided "if you cannot perform the duties or "material and substantial duties&rsquo; of your occupation."</p>
<p>Sometimes the definition may also note that "occupation" can mean a professional's unique specialty such as neurosurgeon, or orthodontist, etc. This may mean that the claim will be payable even if the insured changes careers and earns a substantial income in a new occupation.</p>
<p>In other cases, the occupational definition may only apply for a limited period such as 24 to 60 months of disability. After the duration of the occupational definition ends, the definition may change to one of the three below.</p>
<p>Some occupations do not qualify for an occupational definition and some insureds would not consider an occupational definition worth the extra premium.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_3" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>This definition typically states that the insured is disabled "&hellip;if due to an accident or sickness you are unable to perform the duties of your occupation for which you are reasonably fit by education, training, and experience," and possibly might add "with due regard to prior economic status." This is a good definition from the standpoint of the insured, but is not as liberal as the "full" occupational definition.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_4" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>This is a simpler and considerably less liberal definition than the two above. In this case, disability is defined as something like "&hellip;unable to perform the duties of gainful employment." This definition is not common and would be used in policies that apply to higher risk classifications. This type of coverage would not typically be applied to affluent clients.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_5" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>This type of definition can used to apply to a policy itself as the primary disability definition or as a supplemental rider to a policy with a total disability definition. A residual definition states that the policy will pay benefits in proportion to loss of income attributable to an accident or sickness. If used as a primary definition of disability, this type of disability will provide coverage at a lower premium than a policy with an occupational or gainfully employed definition, and may appeal to certain affluent clients. As a rider, it supplements a total disability definition with a provision for a partial loss of income.</p>
