  <p>When working with a client who is employed by any organization where the employee has no or very little ownership interest, the client's risk management issues are limited to personal and family concerns versus financial responsibilities to employees or business partners.</p>
  <p>When analyzing the needs and solutions for long-term disability, this client will need to coordinate disability, salary continuation, sick pay, and retirement, as well as possible benefits from government programs and any personal financial resources. The case study that begins on the next page illustrates this coordination of benefits and resources to evolve a recommendation of individual disability income insurance. In Case One, we have utilized the Four-Step Process that facilitates an orderly method to ascertain a need for Disability coverage. </p>
