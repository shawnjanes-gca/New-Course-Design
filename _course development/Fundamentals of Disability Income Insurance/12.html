  <p>Let's now stop and review what we have discussed in this course so far and where we are going in the sections ahead. In the introduction, we stated the seven primary objectives and general outline of the course. So far, we have covered the first three objectives, which deal with the risks of long-term disability, the possible options to alleviate the risks of disability, and a broad discussion of the individual disability income insurance contract provisions available in the marketplace.</p>
  <p>We now turn our attention to the practical aspects of applying our understanding of disability risks, possible options to resolve the risk, and disability income insurance to eliminate the risk and to help clients take actions to resolve their exposure. The last four objectives are listed below and serve as an outline for the balance of the course. We will begin on the next page by discussing the use of a 4-step process to determine the need for disability income insurance.</p>
