<p>Fortunately, not every gift to an individual is taxable. We previously discussed the fact that transfers to a spouse or to a qualified charity are excluded from both gift and estate taxes. We will now examine three additional lifetime gifts that are excluded from gift taxes. What is especially important to remember about these three types of excluded gifts is that they not only escape gift taxation when gifted, they also generally are never added back to the estate as post-1976 gifts when we die.</p>
  <p>The first of these are <em><strong>annual exclusion gifts</strong></em>. </p>
  <p>For 2016, lifetime gifts of a <a href="#" title="The recipient enjoys an immediate benefit and the unrestricted right to use, possess, and enjoy the property." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">present interest</a> in the amount of $14,000 or less can be made annually to any individual, and are excluded from the gift tax; this is known as the annual gift tax exclusion. Note that the gift tax exclusion is not limited to gifts to family members; it applies to gifts to ANY INDIVIDUAL. This gift tax exclusion is available each year, making it possible to make repeat gifts to the same person in subsequent years. The amount is also indexed for inflation.</p>
  
  <p>This provides a significant ability for individuals with taxable estates to effectively transfer assets out of their estates without incurring a transfer tax. Given sufficient <a href="#" title="Person or institution to whom a gift is made." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">donees</a> and sufficient years to make transfers, sizeable amounts can effectively avoid taxation. </p>

                 <p>Spouses who are U.S. citizens or resident aliens can “elect to” or “consent to” split gifts between them for a combined $28,000 (in 2016) to any individual, and the entire amount qualifies for the annual gift tax exclusion. This is true even if the source of the funds is entirely from one spouse. A gift tax return must be filed when electing to split a gift.</p>
			  <p>Note: A spouse who is a non-resident alien cannot make a gift-splitting election.</p>

                <p>There is a de minimus rule in regard to record keeping. For gifts of $14,000 or less (in 2016), no gift tax return need be filed, provided gift-splitting is not involved. Just keep personal records; no reporting is necessary. Of course, if the gift exceeds the Annual Exclusion Amount, a tax return must be filed, but you will be able to subtract the annual exclusion amount before computing the tax and would only carry forward the excess on future tax returns (when adding back post-1976 gifts). </p>

                  <p>Normally, gifts between spouses qualify for the unlimited marital deduction and are nontaxable events for gift tax purposes; but the unlimited marital deduction does not apply for a gift to a spouse who is not a U.S. citizen (either resident alien or nonresident alien).</p>
              <p>To mitigate this, an expanded Annual Exclusion Amount of $148,000 (in 2016, as indexed) is allowed for gifts to a non-citizen spouse. This amount is indexed for inflation. </p>
