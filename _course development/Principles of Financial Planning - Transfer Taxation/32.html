  <p>This concludes the material for this subject. As you can see from the list at right, the scope of the material we covered in this course is extensive.  Therefore, at this time you may wish to return to any sections in which you feel the need for further study.</p>
  <p>Note that this subject matter is not static; changes take place each year. Therefore, to remain current, it is important that you find resources to periodically stay abreast of changes, as these may impact the planning strategies that may be utilized.</p>
  <p>Much of this can be picked up in the general news media, but you may be interested in subscribing to the IRS newsletter entitled "IRS e-News for Tax Professionals," which circulates about twice a month. While it covers news in all areas of taxation, it begins with a brief list of topics discussed (usually less than 10), allowing you in less than a minute to discern if there are any topics of interest to you. Towards the end of each year, as gift and estate tax numbers adjust for the next year, this newsletter will also alert you to those changes.</p>
