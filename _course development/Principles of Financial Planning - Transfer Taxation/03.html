  <p>Having done a brief overview of the history of transfer taxes, we now turn our attention to the current status of federal gift and estate taxes. We first focus on those elements that are common to both gift and estate taxes.</p>
  <p>Listed below is the current Federal Unified Rate Schedule that is used in calculating the transfer tax on both lifetime gifts and estates. Under current law, this schedule remains constant for future years.</p>

	<p>Let’s look at an example. Suppose you wish to calculate the transfer tax on $120,000. Here is how you do it:</p>
    <p>Step 1 – Find the row where $120,000 is between the number in Column A and the number in Column B.  As you can see, it is the 7th row, where the range between Column A and Column B is $100,000 to $150,000.</p>
    <p>Step 2 – Identify the tax on the $100,000 amount given in Column A. This is provided in Column C, where we see that the tax on $100,000 is $23,800.</p>
    <p>Step 3 – Now calculate the tax on the amount over $100,000 using the rate found in Column D. Since our amount is $20,000 over the $100,000 for which we have already been provided the tax amount, multiply $20,000 by 30% to get $6,000.</p>
    <p>Step 4 – Add together the tax from Step 2 and Step 3. Thus our tax on the first $100,000 plus the tax on the next $20,000 equals $23,800 + $6,000, for a total tax of $29,800.</p>

  <p><strong>Make note of the highest tax rate: 40%.</strong> This is achieved on all amounts over $1 million. This has not always been the highest rate. As previously discussed, this rate has been much higher in the past. Current legislation, however, dictates that this rate schedule remain fixed unless changed by future legislation.</p>
