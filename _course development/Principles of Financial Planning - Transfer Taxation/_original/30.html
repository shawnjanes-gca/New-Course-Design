<p><strong>"Stepped-Up" Basis Example</strong></p>
<p>An individual purchased a security for $50,000. Years later, when the individual dies, the fair market value of the security is $100,000.</p>
<p>If the asset is liquidated by the executor or distributed to an heir, the basis used for calculating capital gains will be $100,000, not $50,000.</p>

<p>The second aspect of income taxes to be examined is the step-up in basis that occurs at death. Under current law, when a person dies, most assets owned in the estate (with some exceptions such as certain interests in foreign entities and income in respect of a decedent) receive a "step-up" in basis for federal income tax purposes. The result is that instead of using the decedent's purchase price for computing the tax basis of an asset, its tax basis is re-established as of the date of death (or the alternate valuation date 6 months later, if elected by the executor</p>
<p>This has been an important feature of estate planning because it is often possible to avoid paying capital gains taxes simply by holding the asset until death, when the step-up takes place. Since there is currently no limit on the amount of step-up available, substantial income taxes can be avoided in this manner.</p>
