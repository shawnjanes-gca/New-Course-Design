<p>We now turn our attention to what is unique to estate taxes. As we do so, don't confuse the taxable estate with the <a onmouseover="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" onmouseout="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">probate estate</span></a>. The probate process involves the court supervision of the administration of the will, payment of creditors, changing titles to property, and the distribution to heirs. The estate tax process includes all the assets that are probated, but there are other assets owned by the deceased that do not go through probate, yet are included in the estate tax return. Primary examples are life insurance, retirement accounts, and jointly owned property.</p>
<p>Unless an extension is obtained, <strong>the estate tax return is due 9 months after the date of death</strong>. The first step in computing the estate tax is to identify all assets that are included in the <strong>gross estate </strong>(before adjustments) and record them on <strong>Form 706</strong> (the form used for the Estate Tax Return). Essentially, everything owned by the deceased person is included in the gross estate.</p>
<p>It also includes any <em><strong>life insurance</strong></em> owned by the deceased, which might surprise many people. Interestingly enough, life insurance that is on the life of the deceased is includable at its full face amount, not at its lesser cash value that the deceased could have sold it for just prior to death. This is often a considerable percentage of a person's estate. For this reason, it is often advisable to transfer ownership of life insurance to another person or to an irrevocable trust, to get it out of one's estate (assuming this can be accomplished without having to pay a gift tax).</p>
<p>Note, however, that certain transfers <strong><em>within three years of death</em></strong> are deemed to be "in anticipation of death", and are still included in the original owner's estate. This applies to Life Insurance! Thus, to successfully transfer life insurance out of your estate, you must transfer it to another and then live for three more years.</p>
<p>Also included in the gross estate are <strong><em>"incomplete transfers"</em></strong> of property where the person retained certain rights over the property. Examples of incomplete transfers would include those where the person making the transfer retained the right to the income on the property, the right to continue using the property, or the right to control who else would get the income or be able to enjoy the property.</p>
