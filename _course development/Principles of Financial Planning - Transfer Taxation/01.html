<p>Most people have some level of familiarity with federal income taxes. After all, most adults must deal with federal income taxes at some level each year.&nbsp; But federal transfer taxes, e.g., gift, estate, and generation skipping taxes, are a different matter altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part, they only affect people of high net worth; and even then, it is typically just the professionals who assist persons of high net worth who actually deal with the tax issues.</p>
<p>As a professional who works with high net worth clients, it is important that you have some understanding of federal transfer taxes. In fact, to have even the most basic understanding of estate planning requires some knowledge of transfer taxation.</p>
