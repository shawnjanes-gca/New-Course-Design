  <h1><span class="pagetitle">State Transfer Taxes</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Thus far, we have only discussed federal taxes. Depending upon the state in which you reside, state transfer taxes may also impact the tax cost of transfers. Only a handful of states have a gift tax, but all states have some form of death tax. These state death taxes were/are generally in one of the forms listed below.  </p>
  <p>Note that while the federal Applicable Exclusion Amount is currently high enough that federal transfer taxes will not be an issue for most Americans, the same is not necessarily true regarding state transfer taxes. The excluded amount for state taxes may be much lower, shifting the focus of strategies to minimize taxes upon death from federal taxes to state taxes.</p>

              <p>An inheritance tax is the oldest form of death tax, although most states no longer levy it. It is typically levied at a graduated rate based on the amount of the bequest and the relationship to the deceased of the person receiving the bequest. In all states, bequests to spouses are exempt from the inheritance tax. Some states even exempt children and close relatives. In general, the closer the relationship was with the deceased, the less the tax. </p>
