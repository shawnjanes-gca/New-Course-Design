<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Income in Respect of a Decedent</em></strong> (also known as IRD or Code Section 691 income) is income to which the decedent was entitled as of the date of death, but which was not properly includable in the decedent's individual income tax return (Form 1040) under the decedent's method of accounting (typically cash basis or possibly accrual). Any income in respect of a decedent, whether it is received by the estate of the decedent, or payable to a named beneficiary, is likely to be included as an asset of the estate of the decedent. Examples of IRD items for a cash basis taxpayer are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cash dividend received on stock if the record date of the dividend precedes the decedent's date of death.<strong> </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salary and bonuses earned by the decedent, but not by the date of death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deferred salary payments that are payable after death.<strong> </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deferred compensation such as sales incentives or profit sharing to which the decedent was entitled, which is paid to the estate or beneficiary after death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-employed business accounts receivable payments received after the date of death. <strong> </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpaid royalties or rents attributable to pre-death time periods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest accrued prior to date of death, but paid after the date of death.</p>

<p><strong>Deductions for Federal Estate Tax Attributable to IRD</strong> <strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>An individual died in 2008, leaving behind an estate characterized by the following facts:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Adjusted estate is $2,500,000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes an IRA with $110,000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The custodian of the IRA charged a fee after death of $10,000 for managing the assets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes Deferred Compensation of $100,000</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the IRA and the Deferred Compensation are IRD, for a total of $210,000. Adjusting for the $10,000 deduction in respect of a decedent (the custodian fee), that leaves $200,000 of IRD that is in jeopardy of double taxation. To compute the estate tax attributable to the inclusion of this $200,000, you must find the difference between the estate tax inclusive of the $200,000 adjusted IRD and the estate tax without it.</p>

<p>Assuming the IRD assets are paid to the estate, but are not distributed to the beneficiary before the end of the tax year in which the estate receives them, then they are taxed in the fiduciary return and a $90,000 deduction for federal estate tax attributable to IRD can be taken in the fiduciary income tax return. However, if the IRD is distributed to the beneficiary before the end of the estate's tax year in which it was received, then both the IRD and the deduction are passed out to the beneficiary, for inclusion on the beneficiary's income tax return.</p>
