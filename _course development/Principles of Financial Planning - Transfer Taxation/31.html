    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p><strong><em>Income in Respect of a Decedent</em></strong> (also known as IRD or Code Section 691 income) is income to which the decedent was entitled as of the date of death, but which was not properly includable in the decedent's individual income tax return (Form 1040) under the decedent's method of accounting (typically cash basis or possibly accrual). Any income in respect of a decedent, whether it is received by the estate of the decedent, or payable to a named beneficiary, is likely to be included as an asset of the estate of the decedent. Examples of IRD items for a cash basis taxpayer are listed below. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cash dividend received on stock if the  record date of the dividend precedes the decedent&rsquo;s date of death. </li>
    <li>Salary and bonuses earned by the decedent, but  not by the date of death.</li>
    <li>Deferred salary payments that are payable after  death.</li>
    <li>Deferred compensation such as sales incentives  or profit sharing to which the decedent was entitled, which is paid to the  estate or beneficiary after death.</li>
    <li>Self-employed business accounts receivable  payments received after the date of death. </li>
    <li>Unpaid royalties or rents attributable to pre-death  time periods </li>
    <li>Interest accrued prior to date of death, but  paid after the date of death.</li>
  </ul>
