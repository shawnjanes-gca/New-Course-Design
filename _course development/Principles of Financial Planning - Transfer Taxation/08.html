  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Deductions: Unlimited Marital and Charitable</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>

  <p>Unlike the Applicable Credit Amount, which is applied after the tentative tax on the gift or estate is calculated, there are certain deductions that actually reduce the taxable amount of the gift or estate before the tentative tax is calculated. Two important deductions that are available for both gift and estate taxes are: </p>
  <ol>
  	<li><span>The Unlimited Marital Deduction - Transfers of assets to U.S. citizen spouses are non-taxable events regarding gift and estate taxes due to a “marital deduction” that is provided on the gift or estate tax form. This marital deduction is unlimited, so any amount can be transferred to U.S. citizen spouses during life or at death without triggering a gift or estate tax.
    
  	  <div class="example-box">Beware, however, if a spouse is not a U.S. citizen. Non-U.S. citizen spouses are not automatically entitled to the Unlimited Marital Deduction and additional planning must be done in order to get them in a position to receive assets free of estate taxes. </div>
  	  <!-- example-box -->
    </span></li>
    <li><span>Charitable Deductions - Transfers to qualified charities, during one's lifetime or at death, are not subject to transfer taxes.</span></li>
