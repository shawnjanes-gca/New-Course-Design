  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The final aspect of the transfer tax system to be examined is the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GST Tax or GSTT). This tax helps ensure that every generation gets taxed. It is IN ADDITION TO any gift or estate taxes that may be applicable to a transfer. Therefore, situations that require payment of both a gift/estate transfer tax AND a GST tax are generally to be avoided, as they may result in a combined tax that is close to the value of the transfer.</p>
  <p>GST taxation is an area of taxation that is very complex, and usually involves a specialist when it applies. For most professionals, the primary skills needed are:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The ability to identify skip persons to whom the tax applies. </li>
    <li>The ability to identify  events that trigger the tax.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This course will restrict itself to those two skills. </p>
