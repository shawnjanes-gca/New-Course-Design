  <p>When making transfers to lineal descendants, what happens if the parent of a skip-person dies before the transfer? Put simply, the successive generations move up one step to fill the void. </p>

<p> <div class="example-box"> 
 	<p> What happens if there are no surviving lineal descendants? </p>
	<p>In that case, this same adjustment to skip persons can be made for any of the descendants of the transferor's parents or the transferor's spouse's parents. But this only applies when the transferor has no lineal descendants of his/her own.</p>
    <div><em class="explanation-widget-box">
    <h3>Example:  Johnâ€™s Story</h3>
	<p>John has no lineal descendants. His brother, who died last year, was survived by one child and two grandchildren. If John were to make transfers to his deceased brother's grandchildren, they would no longer be considered skip persons. </p>
