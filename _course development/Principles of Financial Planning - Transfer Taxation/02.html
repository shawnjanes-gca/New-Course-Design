  <h3>Tax on the Transfer of Assets</h3>
  
  <p>Federal Gift, Estate, and Generation-Skipping Transfer taxes compose what is commonly referred to as the federal "Transfer Tax System" because they deal with the taxation applied to the transfer of assets. Although there are exceptions, some of which will be addressed in this training, any transfer of assets from one party to another is potentially a taxable event. Knowing when these taxes apply is crucial.</p>
 
  <h3>Gift, Estate, and Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes Have Much In Common</h3>
  
  <p>At one point in our history, lifetime transfers (gift taxes) were taxed under a system that was totally separate from the taxation of transfers upon death (estate taxes). However, beginning in 1976, the estate tax and gift tax were "unified " into a combined system and have shared many common elements since that time. But there are also elements that are unique to each. This course will begin by introducing the common elements of gift and estate taxes, followed by some of the unique characteristics of each. It will then introduce the taxation of transfers that skip a generation, which also shares some common elements with gift and estate taxes.</p>

&lt;p&gt;In 1916, Congress approved the implementation of an estate tax as a &quot;temporary measure&quot; to raise revenue.&lt;/p&gt;">
      <area shape="rect" coords="156,212,295,278" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 Gift Tax: Tax on Lifetime Transfers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To curtail efforts to avoid taxation by making lifetime gifts, Congress enacted a gift tax in 1924. This gift tax co-existed with the estate tax. Two aspects of this arrangement are important for understanding the evolution into our current form of taxation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tax rate on gifts was 25% lower than the rate for estates.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both taxes were independent of the other.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, each calculation took place with no consideration of the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to do away with the preferential tax treatment of lifetime transfers, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 created the Unified Gift and Estate Tax. This &quot;unified&quot; approach continues to this day. Its features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;	A single tax rate&lt;/strong&gt; that is used for calculating both gift and estate taxes.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consideration of lifetime transfers when computing the estate tax.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, lifetime gifts (after 1976) are added back into the estate when computing the estate tax. A credit is then given for any gift taxes that were paid.

&lt;p&gt;To address the attempts to avoid the tax by skipping generations, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 also introduced a generation skipping tax that severely curtailed the ability to skip generations without paying a tax. This tax, when applicable, is in addition to any gift or estate tax that may be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <area shape="rect" coords="153,788,293,853" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 5 Expanded Exclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year following the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the tax rate schedule that was used to calculate the gift and estate tax went as high as 70% on amounts over $5,000,000. However, a tax credit was available to protect the first $120,000 of taxable transfers from actually having to pay a tax. &lt;/p&gt;
With continued political pressure and numerous tax acts later, the tax rate schedule that is currently used to calculate the tax has a maximum rate of 40% on amounts over $1,000,000. Furthermore, for 2016 the available lifetime credit to each person protects the first $5,450,000 (indexed for inflation). This represents a significant rate reduction and a significant expansion of the credit to offset the gift and estate tax.
We will have more to say about the current tax environment on the following pages.

&lt;p&gt;As this &quot;temporary measure&quot; became more permanent, people began looking for ways to avoid the tax. The answer was simple enough: simply transfer assets before you die. If you did not own it when you died, then no tax was due.&lt;/p&gt;

      <area shape="rect" coords="336,323,474,372" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_7" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: Public Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Because the gift tax was less, the public continued to have an incentive to explore ways to make lifetime transfers, particularly through trusts, and avoid the estate tax with its higher rate.

      <area shape="rect" coords="336,518,476,563" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_8" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: Public Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way people had learned to avoid transfer taxes was to make transfers that skipped entire generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose you have three generations: Parent, Child, and Grandchild. Further suppose that your ultimate goal is to keep everything in the family and transfer assets to the grandchild. This could be accomplished in two ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:25px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer through the child.&lt;/strong&gt; Here, the Parent makes a transfer to the Child, who subsequently transfers assets to the original donor's Grandchild. This results in &lt;strong&gt;two taxable transfers&lt;/strong&gt;, one for each successive generation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:25px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer directly to the grandchild.&lt;/strong&gt; Here, the Parent skips the next generation and transfers assets directly to the Grandchild. Only &lt;strong&gt;one taxable &lt;em&gt;transfer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This skipping of generations became a popular approach to minimizing taxes, and trusts were particularly useful vehicles for accomplishing multigenerational transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the boom of the 1990's, there was increased political pressure to raise the amount of an estate that could be transferred free of taxes, with many politicians pushing for the total elimination of the estate tax.&lt;/p&gt;
