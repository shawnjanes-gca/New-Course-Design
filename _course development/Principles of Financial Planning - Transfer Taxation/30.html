  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Step-up in Basis at Death</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The second aspect of income taxes to be examined is the step-up in basis that occurs at death. Under current law, when a person dies, most assets owned in the estate (with some exceptions such as certain interests in foreign entities and income in respect of a decedent) receive a "step-up" in basis for federal income tax purposes. The result is that instead of using the decedent's purchase price for computing the tax basis of an asset, its tax basis is re-established as of the date of death (or the alternate valuation date 6 months later, if elected by the executor.</p>
  <div><em class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>"Stepped-Up" Basis Example</h3>
  <p>An individual purchased a security for $50,000. Years later, when the individual dies, the fair market value of the security is $100,000. </p>
  <p>If the asset is liquidated by the executor or distributed to an heir, the basis used for calculating capital gains will be $100,000, not $50,000.</p>
</em></div>
  <p>This has been an important feature of estate planning because it is often possible to avoid paying capital gains taxes simply by holding the asset until death, when the step-up takes place. Since there was no limit on the amount of step-up available for deaths, substantial income taxes can be avoided in this manner. </p>
