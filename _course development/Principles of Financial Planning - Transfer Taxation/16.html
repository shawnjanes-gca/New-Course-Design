  </h1>
  <p>Property is not always owned outright by a single individual. The inclusion of property in the taxable or probate estate is greatly impacted on how the property is owned. There are four types of co-ownership of property listed below:</p>
 
  <div class="example-box"> 
 	<h3>What You Need to Know about Joint Property</h3>
    <p>For each type of co-ownership of property, it is important to have knowledge of the following points:</p>
 	<ul type="disc">
 	  <li>Where does the property exist? </li>
 	  <li>The number of permissible owners</li>
 	  <li>The relationship of owners, if any </li>
 	  <li>The nature of each person's ownership </li>
 	  <li>What happens when an owner dies? </li>
      <li>How the property is taxed?</li>
    </ul>

              <p>How many owners are allowed? Two or more. </p>
              <p>What is the relationship of the owners? None required, but they may be related.</p>
              <p>What is the extent of each person's ownership interest? Each co-owner has an equal, <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;An&lt;strong&gt; undivided interest&lt;/strong&gt; is where each co-owner has an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;interest in the entire property&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, not just ownership of a piece of the property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if two individuals own an undivided interest in an acre of land, each owner has an ownership interest in the entire acre, rather than one owning the northern half and the other owning the southern half. Each owner, therefore, has the right to make use of the entire acre, not just a piece of it.&lt;/p&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">undivided interest</a>. If there are two owners, they each own ½. If there are three owners, they each own 1/3. </p>
              <p>What happens when an owner dies? Property that is titled in this way does not have to be probated upon death.  The owner’s interest automatically passes to the surviving co-owners. For example, if there were four owners, each with ¼ interest in the property, then when one dies the other three co-owners would have 1/3 interest in the property.</p>
              <p>How is it taxed? The estate tax consequences of Joint Tenancy depend upon whether or not the joint tenants are married:</p>

              <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Non-Spousal Joint Tenancy</strong> - If they are not married (non-spousal) and one owner dies, the IRS will generally presume that the decedent owned 100% of the property. The only way to keep the full amount from being included on the tax return is to prove that the surviving joint tenant(s) contributed funds for its acquisition. If such evidence can be furnished, then the decedent's interest in the property would be reduced to the percentage of the purchase that was actually supplied by the decedent. </li>
              
              <li><strong>Spousal Joint Tenancy</strong> - For couples married  after 1976 and acquiring joint property after that date, ½ of the property is  included in the decedent's taxable estate, regardless of the source of funds  with which the purchase was made. Be aware that some courts have ruled that if  the couple married prior to 1977 and acquired joint property prior to 1977,  then the property is treated just as non-spousal Joint Tenancy. Also, be aware  that these rules do not apply if the decedent&rsquo;s spouse is not a U.S. citizen  (unless the foreign spouse&rsquo;s interest is held in a qualified domestic trust).</li>

              <p><strong>What is the extent of each person's ownership?</strong> Each person holds a percentage interest in the property, the size of which can vary among the co-owners. Usually, their ownership interest is proportional to their contribution to the purchase of the property. Here too, their interest in the property is undivided.</p>
			  <p><strong>What happens when one owner dies?</strong> This type of ownership does not bypass probate, unless it is held in trust. Nor does the owner's interest terminate at death. While alive, each owner has the right to transfer his/her percentage interest at any time, to whomever they wish, independently of the other owners. In like manner, at death, their interest will be distributed according to the terms of their will. </p>
              <p><strong>How is it taxed?</strong> Only the percentage interest that is owned by the decedent is included in his/her estate. In other words, their interest is treated just as if they owned their portion independently of the other owners.</p>

              <p>In most community property states, community property is not a function of how the property is titled.  Rather, it is a function of where a married couple resides when the property is acquired.  With certain exceptions, everything received by a husband and wife while residing in a community property state is considered to be owned 50-50.  When they move out of a community property state, community property will maintain its character as community property, as will any assets that are bought with community property.  However, in Alaska couples must elect community property treatment.</p>
              <p><strong>Where does Community Property exist?</strong> Only in 10 states: Alaska (optional), Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin</p>
              <p><strong>How many owners are allowed?</strong> Two. </p>
              <p><strong>What is the relationship of owners?</strong> Applies only to married couples. </p>
              <p><strong>What is the extent of each person's ownership?</strong> With some exceptions that are discussed in a separate course on Community Property, each spouse owns half of all property acquired during marriage. </p>
              <p><strong>What happens when one owner dies?</strong> Community Property is subject to probate. When one spouse dies, their half interest in the property will be distributed as instructed in the will. </p>
              <p><strong>How is it taxed?</strong> Half of the community property is included in the deceased spouse’s estate for estate tax purposes. Normally, only property that is included in the taxable estate receives a step-up in its tax basis to current market value upon death.  But community property is unique in that respect.  Although only half of it is included in the taxable estate, the entire amount of the community property will generally receive a step-up in basis.</p>
