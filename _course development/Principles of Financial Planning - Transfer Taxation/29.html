  </h1>
  <p>To obtain a charitable deduction on the federal income tax return, a contribution must be made to, or for the use of, certain qualified organizations.  The IRS publishes a list of approved charities in Publication 78. </p>
  <p>Depending upon the type of charity and the type of property being contributed, there is a limit to how much can be deducted in any given year. This limit is stated as a percent of the adjusted gross income of the donor (excluding any net operating loss carryback). If a transfer to a charity exceeds the amount that can be deducted in a given year, the balance of the deduction can be carried forward for 5 years. </p>
  <h3>Types of Charities </h3>
  <p>Only public charities qualify as 50% charities, indicating that up to 50% of an individual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be deducted for the charitable transfer.  All other charities qualify for lesser amounts in a given year.  Note, however, that generally if appreciated property is transferred to a public charity and the deduction is for its fair market value, the limit becomes 30%.</p>

              <p>Public charities are often referred to as 50% limit  organizations because deductions on donations to them are generally limited to  50% of the donor's adjusted gross income (excluding any net operating loss  carry back). They include:</p>
