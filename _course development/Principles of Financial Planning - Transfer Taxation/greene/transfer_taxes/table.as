popUp="This schedule is for either the taxable estate OR for taxable gifts. But developing a common rate schedule that can be used for either can be a bit tricky, as the following example shows:\n"

popUp+="\n		Example: Mr. Jones made a taxable gift during his" 
popUp+="\n		lifetime (after 1976) of $800,000. He died with an" 
popUp+="\n		estate valued at $2,200,000. How do you take into "
popUp+="\n		account his lifetime gift in computing his estate tax?" 

popUp+="\n\n		Answer: First, add together his lifetime taxable gifts "
popUp+="\n		(made after 1976) and his final estate value, deriving "
popUp+="\n		a total of $3 million. Then compute the tax on " 
popUp+="\n		$3 million, deriving his tentative estate tax. " 
popUp+="\n		If he paid any prior tax on his lifetime gift, " 
popUp+="\n		(a likelihood if the gift was made prior to 2002 "
popUp+="\n		when the amount that could be gifted without paying "
popUp+="\n		a tax was much smaller), give him a credit in that "
popUp+="\n		amount against his estate tax. "
popUp+="\n"
popUp+="\n"

popUp2='The tax on a $2,000,000 estate would be $780,800.  Therefore, having a credit of $780,800 would effectively "exclude" $2,000,000 from estate taxation.  For 2007, up to $345,800 of this credit can be applied to lifetime taxable gifts.  Looking at the chart, you can see that this $345,800 credit will cover $1,000,000 of gifts.  We will have more to say on this on the next page.'

popUp3="The maximum rate on the table is 45%. This is achieved on amounts over $1.5 million. While this is a decrease from the 55% maximum rate of 2001, it continues to provide strong incentive for taking advantage of every opportunity to avoid estate taxes through proper estate planning." 

popUp4="Credit Calculation"
popUp4+="\n\nThe Credit calculation uses the credit to offset the tax on the first $2,000,000, which is at the lower rates, leaving the balance of the estate to be taxed at the highest rate."

popUp5="Note: The first taxable dollar is at the 46% marginal rate!"

popUp6="Note: The first taxable dollar would be at 18% if this approach could be used."

popUp7="Exclusion Calculation"

popUp7+="\n\nThe Exclusion calculation would reduce the taxable estate from $3,000,000 to $1,000,000. This would leave the balance being taxed at the lower rates, thereby causing a lower tax bill."
