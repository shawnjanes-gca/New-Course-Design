  <h1><span class="pagetitle">The GST Tax Rate and Exemption</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The GST tax rate is a <em><strong>flat tax</strong></em> that is equal to the highest rate on the Unified Transfer Tax Rate Schedule, which is <strong>40%</strong> under current law.</p>
  <p>As with gift and estate taxes, not all transfers to skip persons are taxed. The following two rules constitute transfers that can be made without having to pay a GST tax:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>All transfers that are excluded from gift taxation are also excluded from GST taxation. This       includes annual exclusion gifts, direct payment of tuition, and direct payment of health care.</li>
      <li>here is a cumulative  exemption amount for GST tax purposes. That cumulative exemption amount is  always equal to the Applicable Exclusion Amount for estates. Only cumulative  taxable transfers to skip persons that exceed that exemption amount are subject  to payment of the GST tax. For 2016, the GST Exemption is $5,450,000 (adjusted  each year for inflation).</li>
    </ul>
</div>
  <!-- example-box -->
<p>Note, however, that while a deceased spouseâ€™s estate can pass on the deceased spousal unused exclusion amount (DSUE amount) to the surviving spouse, this <em><strong>portability is NOT AVAILABLE for the GST Tax Exemption</strong></em>.</p>
  <p>Given that the GST tax is <em><strong>in addition to any gift or estate tax that may be due</strong></em>, the GST tax essentially results in a doubling of the transfer tax liability. This is generally prohibitive! The end result is that the GST tax is generally to be avoided and all transfers subject to the tax should be limited to those that can be protected from having to pay the tax by use of the GST Tax Exemption.</p>
