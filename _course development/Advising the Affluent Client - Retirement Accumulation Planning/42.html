<p>A 10% penalty will generally be levied against any plan withdrawal by a participant if the distribution is made before the participant&rsquo;s attainment of age 59&frac12;.&nbsp; However, there is no penalty for the following premature distributions from qualified plans if made:</p>

<p>To the estate or the beneficiaries following the participant&rsquo;s death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of the participant&rsquo;s total and permanent disability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdrawals are substantially equal annual installments spread over the participant&rsquo;s life expectancy, or the joint life expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary. The payments under this exception, except in the case of death or disability, must continue for at least five years or until the employee reaches age 59&frac12;, whichever is the longer period. This exception only applies after separation from service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After your separation from service in or after the year you reached age 55 (age 50 for public safety employees).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For payment on an IRS levy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of paying medical expenses in excess of 10% of the participant&rsquo;s Adjusted Gross Income</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to a judicial decree under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order</p>
</li>

<p>In the case of the substantially equal annual installments exception, the payments must continue for the later of the participant&rsquo;s attainment of age 59&frac12; or 5 years.&nbsp; For example, if the participant commences the installments at age 57, then the participant must continue withdrawing payments until reaching age 62 (5 years later).</p>
<p>Please note that there are differences between the above list of exceptions and those for the IRA premature exceptions discussed previously.</p>
