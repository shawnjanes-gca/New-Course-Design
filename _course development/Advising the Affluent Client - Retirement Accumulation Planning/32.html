  <h1><span class="pagetitle">SEP IRA</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Small business owners are attracted to the SEP for its simplicity, low set-up costs, and inexpensive annual administrative costs. With a SEP, individual IRAs are established for each employee. Self-employed individuals may open a SEP IRA, in which case the individual is both the employee and the employer. Once the employer makes contributions, these SEP IRAs are subject to the same rules regarding transfer, withdrawal and taxation as a Traditional IRA. Uniquely, the SEP IRA has been called the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procrastinator's Retirement Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most employer-sponsored retirement plans require set-up before the end of the tax year in order to make a tax-deductible contribution for that year. The SEP IRA may be set up as late as the due date of the income tax return, including extensions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 2em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tom T. Tardy is your client.  He's panicked because he needs to set up a retirement plan for his business, fund a contribution, and deduct the contribution on his Year 1 income tax return. But Tom has a problem.  Today's date is now September 30 of Year 2! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a solution. Tom may set up and fund a SEP IRA by October 15, Year 2 and take the income tax deduction on his Year 1 income tax return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">procrastinator’s retirement plan</a> because of its liberal set-up deadlines.</p>

              <p>In a SEP IRA, only employer contributions are permitted - employee salary reduction deferrals are not allowed. However, prior to January 1, 1997, a SEP IRA could have included a salary reduction arrangement (known as a SARSEP) whereby employees could elect to defer compensation and have the funds placed in an IRA.  While a SARSEP created prior to that date may continue to function, new SARSEP plans cannot be created. They have been replaced with SIMPLE Plans.  </p>
