<p>Your client may have at least two more concerns even after a thorough analysis points toward the conversion of a Traditional IRA (or employer-sponsored retirement plan balance) to a Roth IRA. Although these concerns may not be articulated, your client may wonder, &ldquo;What if I need cash for an emergency?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What if I change my mind after I pull the trigger on conversion?&rdquo; You may be able to address those concerns using the following insights.</p>
<h3>What If I Need Cash for an Emergency?</h3>
<p>Withdrawal of contributions from a Roth IRA are income tax-free. Income tax was paid at conversion and hence income tax on the converted funds will never be paid again. The key is to avoid penalty from those withdrawals. Converted funds may be withdrawn without penalty if the withdrawal is made AFTER five years from conversion. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> to learn more.</strong></p>
<h3>What if I Change My Mind?</h3>
<p>It is possible to reverse the conversion in a process the IRS describes as &ldquo;recharacterization.&rdquo; The IRS defines recharacterization as a process that &ldquo;allows you to &lsquo;undo&rsquo; or &lsquo;reverse&rsquo; a conversion to a Roth IRA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the clock is ticking! Recharacterization of a conversion must be made no later than October 15 of the following year. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example. </strong>&nbsp;Noteworthy:&nbsp; A <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>special restriction</strong></a> applies to recharacterization of employer-sponsored retirement plan conversions.</p>

<h4>Withdrawal of Converted Funds From a Roth IRA</h4>
<p>There is an order of withdrawal from Roth IRAs that generally requires original Roth IRA contributions be withdrawn first (penalty-free). Next in the sequence, converted Roth IRA contributions are withdrawn (penalty-free if taken five years after conversion). Finally, after all original and converted contributions are withdrawn, earnings are withdrawn. Please refer to our previous discussion of Roth IRAs in this course for a reminder of when earnings may be withdrawn without income tax or penalty.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Your client, Mr. Lestrade, converted a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA on January 1, Year 1. If Mr. Lestrade changes his mind and wishes to reverse the conversion, he must do so by October 15, Year 2. Noteworthy: The October 15 deadline applies even if Mr. Lestrade does not file the automatic six-month extension of time to file his income tax return.</p>

<h4>Special Restriction - Recharacterization of Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan to Roth IRA Conversion</h4>
<p>If the conversion was funded from an employer-sponsored retirement plan, recharacterization is permitted. However the recharacterized funds may only transfer from the Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA - the funds cannot transfer back to the employer-sponsored retirement plan.</p>
