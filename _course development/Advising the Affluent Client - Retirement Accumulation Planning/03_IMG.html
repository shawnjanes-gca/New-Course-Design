  <p>Retirement planning currently represents one of the greatest areas of need among clients, offering a significant boost in productivity for advisors who gain the conversational competence to address this need with their clients and prospects.</p>
  <p>
  <div class="example-box">
   	<ul>
        	<li>The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the population of retirees is the fastest-growing segment of the American population.</li>
			<li>Less than 2 of every 10 workers are “very confident” in having enough saved to live comfortably in retirement based upon The Employee Benefit Research Institute’s 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey®.</li>
			<li>The Investment Company Institute® announced that retirement assets reached $23 trillion as of December 31, 2013.</li>
			<li>CNNMoney.com states that only 60% of workers over 40 who are eligible to participate in their 401(k) are actually doing so.</li>
			<li>Fidelity Investments research shows that Baby Boomers on average can expect to be able to replace only 59% of their pre-retirement income while less than 57% can expect to receive a pension from their employer.</li>
			<li>Retiree health costs and uncertainty over new health care laws increasingly rank among most retirees primary concerns.</li>
			<li>The CDC’s National Center for Health Studies states that life expectancy has increased by more than thirty years in the last century.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>One might think that, given this information, most Americans would be actively planning toward their number one financial goal. However, The Employee Benefits Research Center found in their recent <em>Retirement Confidence Survey®</em> that <em><strong>only 4 out of 10 workers have even tried to calculate how much money they need to accumulate for retirement</strong></em>.</p>
  <p>Perhaps people are simply overwhelmed by the ongoing media coverage of issues like the continuing decline of the savings rate, the increasing income needs of current retirees, concerns regarding the future of Social Security, the increase in the numbers of retirees, health care costs, or the growing life expectancy and the resulting drain on resources.  As an old adage of the financial services industry states: “The confused mind ALWAYS says No!” A strong case can be made that many people have simply run up the white flag as it pertains to their retirement. This tendency is apparent in a Met Life study, <em>Living Longer, Working Longer</em>, which found that the majority of those surveyed intended to, or were <em>resigned to</em>, work during their retirement.</p>
  <p>Even though it would seem virtually impossible for clients and prospects to remain unaware of the dire forecasts around retirement planning, nearly all retirement services advertising uses idyllic images of travel or hobbies like the one pictured on this page. In the face of the differences between reality and those images, advisors must differentiate themselves by understanding the realities and how to plan for them in a way that makes the ideal attainable. That differentiation begins with understanding the client’s retirement lifecycle.</p>
