  <p>A contribution to a Traditional IRA is always permitted for an individual meeting the age and taxable compensation requirements, but the deductibility of the contribution is subject to the “active participant” and “modified AGI phase-out” restrictions. </p>
  <p>Roth IRAs are different. Even for clients meeting the taxable compensation requirement (there is no age requirement), the ability to make a Roth IRA contribution may be reduced or eliminated based upon modified AGI. The phase-out ranges are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>If modified AGI falls below the bottom of the phase-out range, then the full Roth IRA contribution is authorized. If modified AGI exceeds the top of the phase-out range, then no contribution to a Roth IRA is possible.</p>
  <p>Now let us equip you to answer the client question “How much can I contribute if I make more than the minimum but less than the maximum?” Clients with modified AGI within the phase-out ranges are allowed only partial Roth IRA contributions. To the extent a client’s modified AGI encroaches into the phase-out range, a corresponding percentage of eligibility is lost. Click <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlene is age 40, files as a single taxpayer and has a modified AGI of $120,750 in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase-out for her filing status is $15,000 “wide,” spanning a range from $117,000 through 132,000 (2016). Charlene’s modified AGI exceeds the bottom of the phase-out range by $3,750 ($120,750 – $117,000). Hence, her modified AGI has encroached into the phase-out range by $3,750. In percentage terms, the encroachment is $3,750/$15,000, or 25%.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because her modified AGI encroaches 25% into the phase-out range, she must reduce her contribution by 25%. The maximum Roth IRA contribution for an individual younger than age 50 in 2016 is $5,500. In Charlene’s case, we must reduce her maximum contribution by 25%, which results in a 2016 maximum Roth IRA contribution of $4,125 (75% of $5,500).&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">here</a> for an example. </p>

 </div></p>
<p>There are two potential solutions if your client makes too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA - <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Deferrals into a Designated Roth account (DRA) in a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) Plan are NOT subject to the adjusted gross income phase-out rules. Just as every sword has two edges, this option slices to your client’s advantage and disadvantage as well. There is no required beginning date for distributions from a Roth IRA; however, there is a required beginning date from DRAs in 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) Plans.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Designated Roth Accounts</a> and the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Here is how to take advantage of the rules that allow conversion of a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Your client simply makes a regular contribution to a Traditional IRA. Next, he or she immediately converts the Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Voila! Your client now has a Roth IRA. This strategy is not for all clients. Unwanted income taxes will result if your client has other Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs. Be sure to involve your client’s CPA, CFP® professional, tax attorney, or other tax professional before this strategy is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Backdoor Roth IRA</a>.</p>
