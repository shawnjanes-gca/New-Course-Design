<p>How will you respond when your prospective client asks, &ldquo;Should I contribute to a Roth IRA?&rdquo; Join us as we equip you for a clear and crisp response. The best fit for a Roth IRA contribution is a client placing a high value upon the following.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The Roth IRA provides more after-tax income than the Traditional IRA when future income tax rates are significantly higher than current income tax rates. That would, of course, mean that taxable income actually rises in retirement. In this happy circumstance, your client gives up the income tax deduction for contributions at a relatively low income tax rate in exchange for tax-free income during retirement at a relatively high income tax rate.</p>
<p>That retirement outcome may be uncommon in reality so let&rsquo;s examine a more likely scenario. Assume that income tax rates are moderately lower in retirement - the Roth IRA should still be considered!</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Your client Gertrude Greenbax is 35 years of age, has an adjusted gross income of $100,000, plans to retire at age 67, and wishes to contribute $5,500 annually to an IRA. Her current income tax rate is 25% and her income tax rate in retirement will be 15%.</p>
<p>Should she contribute annually to a deductible Traditional IRA or Roth IRA? She would accumulate just under $649,000 by retirement age if she chose the Roth IRA, while she would accumulate just over $651,000 in a deductible Traditional IRA (after accounting for income taxes). These results are based upon the referenced online calculator.</p>

<p>In the foregoing example, there was little difference in tax-adjusted account balances at age 67. Yet, no one&rsquo;s money is safe when Congress is in session! Even a lackluster case for the Roth IRA begins to shine if Congress raises income tax rates. Regrettably, the reverse is also true. The income tax benefits of the Roth IRA may be lost or reduced if Congress significantly lowers income tax rates.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line: Use your internal resources or compliance-approved online calculators to run the numbers before automatically recommending a deductible Traditional IRA.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The Roth IRA is unique in that no distributions are required during the original owner&rsquo;s lifetime. The reason is quite simple. The IRS collects no income tax when Roth IRA distributions are made. Virtually all other tax-deferred retirement vehicles, including qualified plans, are subject to required minimum distributions during the owner&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This benefit appeals to clients who choose to work in retirement and wish to continue saving on a tax-efficient basis. Unlike Traditional IRAs, contributions to Roth IRAs may be made at any age, even if past age 70&frac12;, as long as the individual has earned income.</p>

<p>What better inheritance than income tax-free distributions for your loved ones? Roth IRA distributions remain income tax-free when taken by beneficiaries. A married client, at the death of the first spouse, can build an even <a id="clockButton" onclick="toggleClock()" href="#_s"><strong>larger income tax-free legacy</strong></a> for children or grandchildren.</p>

<h4>Larger Income Tax-Free Legacy</h4>
<p>As a little known insight, the owner of a Roth IRA may name her spouse as beneficiary and, at her death, her surviving spouse may rollover her Roth into an inherited Roth IRA for himself. The surviving spouse may choose to become the new owner or be treated as a beneficiary. This strategy requires that he becomes the new owner.</p>
<p>He is not required to take required minimum distributions during his lifetime. This is an opportunity to build an even larger income tax-free legacy for the couple&rsquo;s loved ones, such as children or grandchildren.</p>
