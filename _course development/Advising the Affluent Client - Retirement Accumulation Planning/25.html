  <p>This is one of the major decisions that clients routinely face and merits a closer examination. We will approach this decision as any other financial decision - by comparing benefits and costs. Specifically, our discussion will begin with an overview followed by an analysis of significant factors in the conversion decision.</p>

  </ul>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Your client may convert account balances from a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;The following account types are generally eligible for conversion into a Roth IRA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designated Roth Accounts in 401(k), Roth 403(b), and Roth 457(b) Plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional IRAs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs (subject to the two-year rule)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Roth Accounts in Qualified Plans and 403(b) Plans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-Year Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMPLE IRAs may not be converted, transferred, or rolled into a Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA during the first two years of the SIMPLE IRA. The two-year period begins with the first employer contribution to the employee’s SIMPLE IRA. The two-year rule prevents circumvention of the 25% SIMPLE IRA premature distribution penalty. If conversions of a SIMPLE IRA were allowed during the first two years, taxpayers would merely convert to other accounts in which the premature distribution penalty is only 10%. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

The conversion results in inclusion of any <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;In converting pretax funds to a Roth IRA, the owner is essentially making a withdrawal from the prior account, usually an early withdrawal (premature distribution). This would normally result in a 10% penalty to the extent of the taxable portion of the converted funds. However, no penalty is due if the owner meets the requirements in the tax year of the transfer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The conversion is a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a rollover, the rollover is completed within 60 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unlimited number of trustee-to-trustee transfers are allowed per year. Only one rollover per year is permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">untaxed amounts</a> into income.</p>

<p>This is how untaxed amounts are included in income for the year of conversion.</p>

<h3>Example 1 – Conversion from a Qualified Plan</h3>
<p>Your client George (45 years of age) just accepted a position with a new employer. George has $500,000 in his previous employer's 401(k) Plan. George made no after-tax contributions to the 401(k) Plan. He is in your office and asks if he should roll the $500,000 into a Roth IRA. His current income tax rate is 25%. If he converts to a Roth IRA, the additional income tax payable due to the conversion will be $137,000. </p>
<h3>Example 2 – Conversion from a Nondeductible Traditional IRA</h3>
<p>Your client George (45 years of age) owns a Nondeductible Traditional IRA with an account balance of $500,000. He contributed $120,000 in after-tax dollars to the IRA.  The amount taxable at conversion is $380,000. The income tax payable due to the conversion will be 25% of $380,000, or $95,000. </p>
<p>Noteworthy - Had George also owned deductible IRA accounts in Example 2, the calculation would have been more complex and George would not have been able to exclude the full $120,000 in after-tax contributions from taxation at the conversion.</p></div></p>

<h3>Benefits of Conversion</h3>
  <p>The promise of a tax-free income stream is usually the first and primary driver behind conversion of pretax qualified plan or Traditional IRA accounts to a Roth IRA. Clients expecting to pay higher income tax rates in retirement may benefit from conversion.</p>
  <p>However, as we will demonstrate subsequently, even clients expecting income tax rates to remain the same or drop slightly may also benefit from conversion.</p>
  <p>The flexibility to take or avoid Roth IRA distributions during retirement is a second powerful benefit.</p>
  <p>A third set of benefits includes the potential reduction of other costs, such as income tax on Social Security retirement benefits, minimization of the 3.8% Net Investment Income tax, and reduction of certain Medicare premiums. We will provide additional detail on these opportunities later in this course in “ Lowering AGI is a Good Thing - Roth IRA Unique Planning Opportunities.”</p>
  
  <h3>Costs of Conversion</h3>
  <p>Income tax must be paid on any untaxed amounts for the year of conversion. However, the true tax cost may exceed merely the income tax payable on converted amounts. Because conversion may dramatically increase your client’s adjusted gross income in the conversion year, your client’s marginal tax rate may increase.</p>
   <p>If that were not enough, the increase to adjusted gross income may cause the reduction or loss of itemized deductions and exemptions under the phase-out rules governing those deductions. Your client may also lose eligibility for education credits and student loan interest deductions. The moral of the story is that the income tax on the converted untaxed income may be just a part of the total tax cost!</p>
   
   <!--Planning Tips-->
   <p><div>
   <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /> Planning Tip #1</h3>
 </div></p>
 <p>Conversion may be a multi-year process rather than a single year event. Spreading the conversion over a number of years may save significant income taxes by avoiding increases to your client’s marginal income tax rate.</p>
 <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3>Dennis wishes to convert his Traditional Deductible IRA to a Roth IRA.  Assume Dennis files married filing jointly and has taxable income of $120,000. His marginal income tax rate is 25%. Further assume that his marginal income tax rate will increase to 28% when taxable income exceeds $150,000.  Dennis could convert $30,000 without paying a higher income tax rate on converted funds.</div>
 
 <p><div>
   <h3><img src="https://learning.greeneconsults.com/topclass/course-page-layout/images/icon-info.png" alt="icon-info" width="49" height="50" /> Planning Tip #2</h3>
 </div></p>
  
<p>If your client experiences a poor earnings year, then consider using the lower marginal tax rates in that year to save income taxes on conversion. For example, if your client’s average tax rate is 33% but that rate falls to 25% in the current year, then a $50,000 conversion would cost $4,000 less in income taxes. That savings is calculated as conversion income of $50,000 multiplied by the decreased tax rate of 8% (33% less 25%).</p>
 <!--End of Planning Tips-->
 
<h3>Life Expectancy</h3>
  <p>Longer life expectancy means collecting more tax-free Roth IRA income in retirement. Assuming that your client’s income tax rate is higher or approximately the same in retirement than in the conversion year, longer life expectancies provide greater after-tax income streams than shorter life expectancies.</p>
  <p>But that is not the whole story. If we broaden our perspective from your client to include your client’s heirs, then a slightly different picture may emerge. </p>
  <div id="p7SMLcontent_2" class="sml-content">
    <div id="p7SMLwrapper_2">
      <p><div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3>
<p>Your client Marilyn, age 55, is a late-career professional in excellent health. She plans to retire at age 66. Marilyn converted her deductible Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA earlier this year. She expected to be in a higher income tax bracket in retirement and further expected to outlive her statistical life expectancy of 84 years.  </p>
<p>Regrettably, she was killed last week after an inexperienced bungee jump technician dialed in the wrong setting on her bungee cord. In retrospect, did her untimely death make the decision to convert a poor financial decision? That depends entirely upon the income tax rates of her beneficiaries! </p> 
<p>If her beneficiaries are in a higher income tax bracket than Marilyn, then the conversion decision remains an effective financial decision. However, conversion was not an effective financial decision if her beneficiaries are in a significantly lower income tax bracket. In that case, Marilyn will have paid a relative high income tax rate to provide income tax-free distributions to beneficiaries in relatively low income tax brackets.</p>

  </blockquote>
  
    
  <h3>Beneficiary Designation</h3>
  <p>Beneficiary designations are not the primary driver for the conversion decision for most clients. However, just as your client’s income tax rates impact the conversion decision, beneficiary income tax rates should be considered as well.</p>
  <p>For example, if the beneficiary is a tax-exempt charity, the charity will receive fewer dollars after conversion to a Roth IRA than before conversion. This assumes that conversion-related income taxes were paid with Traditional IRA funds.</p>
  <p>What if the beneficiary is a loved one, such as child or grandchild? In this case, the higher the beneficiary’s income tax rate, the more beneficial the inherited Roth IRA will be.</p>
   
  <h3>Comparing Benefits and Costs</h3>
  <p>Your internal resources and your client’s CPA or CFP® professional should be consulted for your client’s specific needs and financial profile. An online calculator<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup> may also give general guidance in balancing costs and benefits.</p>
