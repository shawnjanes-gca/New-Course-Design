<p>If you look up the word "goal" in Dictionary.com, you will see it defined as:</p>
<p><em>The state of affairs that a plan is intended to achieve and that (when achieved) terminates the behavior intended to achieve it. </em></p>
<p>Thus, a goal must contain sufficient "specificity" to allow a person to: 1) identify an appropriate plan of action; and 2) recognize when it is achieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you begin conversations with clients or prospects about their individual retirement situations, they will typically describe their retirement goals with words such as, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to maintain my lifestyle; be comfortable, so to speak.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, their response is likely to be nonspecific and inadequate for the purpose of creating a plan of action.</p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p>As you work with pre-retirees around this very important consideration, it is imperative that you help them achieve clarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What specific objectives are there around the lifestyle they would like to accomplish?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much money, in today&rsquo;s dollars, must they accumulate to meet their needs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When and where do they plan to live during retirement?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These and many more specific considerations make up their individual retirement reality. Once clarity is achieved, that clarity becomes your client&rsquo;s clear retirement plan and should be formalized in writing.</p>
