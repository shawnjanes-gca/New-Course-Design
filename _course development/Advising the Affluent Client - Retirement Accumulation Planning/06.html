  <p>If you look up the word "goal" in Dictionary.com, you will see it defined as: </p>
  <blockquote style="font-size:10pt;"><i>The state of affairs that a plan is intended to achieve and that (when achieved) terminates the behavior intended to achieve it.</i></blockquote>
 
  <p>Thus, a goal must contain sufficient "specificity" to allow a person to: 1) identify an appropriate plan of action; and 2) recognize when it is achieved. </p>

<p>However, when you begin conversations with clients or prospects about their individual retirement situations, they will typically describe their retirement goals with words such as, “I’d like to maintain my lifestyle; be comfortable, so to speak.”  In other words, their response is likely to be nonspecific and inadequate for the purpose of creating a plan of action. </p> 

<p>As you work with pre-retirees around this very important consideration, it is imperative that you help them achieve clarity:</p>
<div class="imageRight"> Quote goes here.  <br>It is not an image. <br>I was just using this as a placeholder. </div>
<ul>
	<li>What specific objectives are there around the lifestyle they would like to accomplish?
	  
	</li>
    <li>How much money, in today’s dollars, must they accumulate to meet their needs?</li>
    <li>When and where do they plan to live during retirement?</li>

</ul>
<p>These and many more specific considerations make up their individual retirement reality. Once clarity is achieved, that clarity becomes your client’s clear retirement plan and should be formalized in writing.</p>
