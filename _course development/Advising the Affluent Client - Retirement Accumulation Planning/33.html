<p>A small business owner may consider the SIMPLE IRA for its deferral opportunities (not available in the SEP) and relatively administrative costs when compared to qualified plans.</p>
<p>A SIMPLE IRA is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows the employee (including self-employed individuals) to make pre-tax compensation deferrals. The employer is also required to make contributions. Once established, the SIMPLE IRA offers very appealing benefits, although it also has noteworthy restrictions.</p>

<div id="p7ABc2_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>To be eligible to start a SIMPLE IRA, a business must meet two requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Employ 100 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation in the previous year, and</p>

<div id="p7ABc2_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Employers are required to make contributions, but have some flexibility in choosing between two methodologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Match participating employee deferrals dollar-for-dollar, provided the match does not exceed 3% of the employees&rsquo; compensation (on compensation up to $265,000, as indexed in 2015). If this method is chosen, the employer has the further flexibility to elect a lower matching contribution of not less than 1% in any two out of five years. Employees must be notified of the matching amount before the beginning of each new plan year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AND</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contribute a fixed 2% of employee compensation (on compensation up to $265,000 for 2015) on behalf of all employees, whether the employees elect to make any contributions themselves or not. This translates into a maximum employer contribution per employee of $5,300 (2015).</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw2_4">
<div id="p7ABc2_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Here is a rule that your clients simply must know. If early withdrawals occur (i.e., distributions prior to age 59&frac12;) within the 2-year period following the date of the employee's first participation, the 10% IRS penalty tax is increased to 25% unless an exception applies (e.g., death, disability, etc.). Premature distribution penalties from other types of IRAs incur a smaller penalty of only 10%. The SIMPLE IRA 25% penalty may not be avoided by rolling over a SIMPLE IRA to another type of IRA within the 2-year period described above.</p>
