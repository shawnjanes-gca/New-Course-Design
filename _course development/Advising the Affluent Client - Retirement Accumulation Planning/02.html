<p>When asked to identify their primary financial goals or objectives, many of your clients will assign retirement planning the number one priority in their lives. Yet their actions often contradict that focus. This presents you with one of the stronger opportunities of your profession. However, the challenge in addressing this opportunity is getting clients to maintain their focus on planning for an event that may be remote, rather than allowing the immediacy of life and current financial demands to drain their resolve and resources.</p>
<p>Traditionally, planning for retirement primarily involved gathering and growing assets with advisors who assisted clients in developing an accumulation strategy and were valued for their expertise. Today, however, advisors should segment the process of retirement planning into two phases or stages:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Pre-Retirement Accumulation Planning, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post-Retirement Distribution Planning.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This particular course will focus on the first phase: Pre-Retirement Accumulation Planning.</p>
<p>Each phase requires a unique set of skills and abilities to address the needs clients typically have at each of these important points in their lives. In order to assist clients with these issues, we present the following objectives for this course.</p>
