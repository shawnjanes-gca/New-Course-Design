<p>Why would your client consider an IRA? Clients are attracted to IRAs for at least four powerful advantages.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Favorable Tax Treatment on Contributions</strong> &ndash; Contributions to certain Traditional IRAs may be deductible on your client&rsquo;s income tax return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Favorable Tax Treatment of Earnings &ndash; </strong>Earnings are not taxed until withdrawn from the IRA. Therefore, the assets in the account grow faster without the erosion of annual tax liabilities. In the case of the Roth IRA, the earnings are generally not ever subject to tax, provided certain rules are followed.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bankruptcy Protection - </strong>IRAs are generally exempt from an individual&rsquo;s creditors in bankruptcy under federal law up to $1,242,475 (2015). Certain states have established higher exemption amounts. The bankruptcy protection is not absolute: the IRS may levy IRA funds to satisfy unpaid taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Prohibited by Participation in a Qualified Plan &ndash; </strong>Although participation in an employer-sponsored plan may impact the deductibility of contributions to a Traditional IRA, participation in a Traditional IRA is not prohibited by participation in an employer-sponsored plan. <strong>Thus, IRAs can be a valuable supplement to employer-sponsored plan savings.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In comparison, contributions to a Roth IRA are never affected by contributions to an employer-sponsored plan, but may be limited by the contributor's modified adjusted gross income.</li>
</ul>
