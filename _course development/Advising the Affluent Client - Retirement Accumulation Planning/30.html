<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting strategy. What if your client could establish one account to pay medical expenses with tax-free dollars, receive an income tax deduction for contributions <strong><em>and</em></strong> create tax-deferred retirement income? The HSA, nicknamed &ldquo;health care IRA&rdquo; by some, has the potential to accomplish this impressive triple play. While not technically an IRA, the HSA combines the following benefits of both Roth and deductible Traditional IRAs.</p>

<p>Withdrawal of contributions and earnings are income tax-free if used to pay for <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s">qualified medical expenses</a></strong>.</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>If HSA funds are not required for medical expenses, distributions may be taken to supplement a client&rsquo;s retirement income.</p>

<p>To this impressive list we can add one benefit found in no IRA - earned income is not required to contribute to an HSA. However, in retirement accumulation planning, as in life itself, there is no free lunch. Whereas Traditional and Roth IRAs enjoy bankruptcy protection under federal law, bankruptcy protection of HSAs is based upon state law. Not all states exempt HSA balances from an individual&rsquo;s creditors in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>When HSAs were enacted in 2003, relatively few individuals or families were eligible because a <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)</strong></a> was required. HDHPs are still required; yet, as higher deductible health plans are increasingly adopted by employers, more clients and employers are adopting HSAs. Over 800,000 new HSAs were created between 2012 and 2013 according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute<sup>&reg;1</sup> . Individuals covered by Medicare and those who can be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer&rsquo;s income tax return are not eligible for an HSA.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the power of the HSA.</p>
<table style="width: 650px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Your client Bruce, age 35, contributed and deducted $5,500 to a deductible Traditional IRA for 2015. Bruce also qualifies for an HSA because he is covered under an HDHP and has no other health insurance. His IRA contribution does not reduce his maximum HSA contribution and any HSA contributions do not reduce his maximum IRA contribution.</p>
<p>He may contribute and deduct $3,350 (2015, as indexed) to an HSA. Assuming that Bruce makes annual contributions of $3,350 for the next 30 years and uses only one-half of each annual contribution for medical expenses, his HSA will grow to over $140,000 at a 6% annual net investment return.</p>
The annual HSA contribution, in a 28% marginal tax bracket, also saves Bruce over $900 annually in federal income taxes.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The HSA would be a powerful strategy even if it did not offer a potential addition to a client&rsquo;s retirement income. However, at age 65, the 20% penalty for nonqualified withdrawals disappears and distributions may be taken penalty-free to supplement a retiree&rsquo;s income. Taxable income will result to the extent withdrawals are taken for nonqualifying purposes.</p>
