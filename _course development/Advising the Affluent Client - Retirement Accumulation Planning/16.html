IRA contributions MUST be based solely on the portion of taxable income that is received as compensation earned from personal services. But, as the following table illustrates, taxable compensation for IRA purposes includes income that is not always thought of as “earned.”" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">taxable compensation</a> can set up a Roth IRA. Age is not a factor for Roth IRA eligibility. Taxable compensation is also required to set up a Traditional IRA, but there is an age limit as well.</p>
