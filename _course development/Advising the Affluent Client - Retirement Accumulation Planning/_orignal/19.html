<h3>Prohibited IRA Investments</h3>
<p>IRA funds can be invested in a wide range of investments with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Generally,</em></strong> <strong><em>collectibles are NOT permissible investments</em></strong>. Collectibles include items purchased as an investment, such as art, rugs, antiques, gems, stamps, and rare coins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, gold, silver, or platinum coins minted by the U.S. government or political subdivision thereof may be purchased by an IRA if purchased directly from the government. Please note that precious metal bullion is not considered a &ldquo;collectible&rdquo; and is an acceptable IRA investment.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Life insurance may NOT be held in an IRA.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Prohibited Transactions</h3>
<p>Certain transactions in an IRA are prohibited. If an IRA owner or beneficiary engages in a prohibited transaction, then immediate income taxation and potential premature distribution penalty will result. Examples of <strong><em>prohibited transactions</em></strong> include the following transactions between the IRA owner and the IRA:</p>
