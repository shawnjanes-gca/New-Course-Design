<p>Conventional wisdom holds that current and future income tax rates should be the driver in deciding between Roth and non-Roth contributions during the accumulation period. Conventional wisdom is not wrong; however, it may be superficial. There are other valuable and unique Roth IRA planning opportunities seldom appreciated by advisors much less articulated to clients.</p>
<p>Each of the three unique opportunities discussed below have a common theme &ndash; saving money by reducing a client&rsquo;s adjusted gross income through Roth IRA distributions.</p>

<p>Social Security retirement benefits may or may not be taxable.

<p>Here is how your client could save over $5,000 not just once, but annually in income taxes on Social Security retirement benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Your client Janine is in her first year of retirement and expects to withdraw $25,000 in taxable distributions every year during her retirement from her Traditional IRA.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because of her other (non Social Security) income, Janine falls in the 85% income inclusion range from the graph above and her income tax rate is 25%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She must include $21,250 (85%) of the $25,000 in gross income on her income tax return and the income tax on the $21,250 (25%) will be just over $5,300.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If Janine could go back into time and contribute to Roth IRAs instead of Traditional IRAs, her income tax free $25,000 in annual distributions would NOT drive up AGI and hence, potentially none of the $25,000 in Social Security retirement benefits would have been included in gross income on her income tax return.</p>
<ul>
<li>Janine would have saved (potentially) over $5,300 annually in income taxes on her Social Security retirement benefits.</li>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Avoid or Minimize the NIIT (Net Investment Income Tax)</strong></a></h3>

<div id="p7ABw1_3">

<p>Your client could potentially save thousands of dollars by understanding the effect of Roth IRA distributions upon the NIIT.</p>
<p>The year 2013 ushered in an unprecedented Medicare tax on unearned income such as investment income. This tax may be referred to as either the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) or the 3.8% Medicare Surtax. The NIIT is assessed against the lesser of AGI in excess of an indexed amount or <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s">net investment income</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Distributions from Traditional IRAs and most employer-sponsored retirement plans are not considered investment income subject to the NIIT. Yet such distributions can indirectly cause additional NIIT because they are included in a taxpayer&rsquo;s income. Here is how that works.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributions from Traditional IRAs and most employer-sponsored retirement plans increase a client&rsquo;s AGI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases to AGI may result in additional NIIT because the NIIT is assessed against the lesser of AGI in excess of an indexed amount or net investment income.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Roth IRA distributions are excluded from taxable income and consequently do NOT increase a taxpayer&rsquo;s adjusted gross income. As a result, taxpayers taking Roth distributions instead of taxable distributions may reduce or even eliminate the 3.8% NIIT.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>When would anyone ever overpay for health insurance premiums? Whenever they fail to take advantage of the Roth IRA to reduce those premiums that is when! Premiums for Medicare Parts B and D are means tested. Means testing is a term applied to the increase in premiums based upon an individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income.</p>
<p>Medicare Part B covers physician services and outpatient care. Part B coverage requires payment of a monthly premium that varies dramatically based upon your client&rsquo;s modified AGI. Joint income tax return filers with modest AGIs pay as little as $1,250 (2015) per year while higher AGI joint filers may pay over 320% of that amount annually ($4,000 (2015)).</p>
<p>Medicare Part D covers prescription drug costs and requires payment of a monthly premium as well. The monthly Part D premium payment increases as modified AGI increases - a married couple&rsquo;s annual premium can increase approximately $1,500 at higher AGI levels.</p>
<p>Roth IRA distributions do not increase modified AGI and, so far as Medicare Parts B and D premiums go, happiness is a low modified AGI!</p>
