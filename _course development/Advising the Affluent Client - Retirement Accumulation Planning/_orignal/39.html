<p>These plans do not define the benefits the employee receives upon retirement. Rather, they define the procedures under which contributions <strong>may or may not</strong> be made by the participant or employer to each participant's account. Contributions are not always guaranteed in Defined Contribution Plans. Benefits upon retirement depend on the amount of plan contributions, how long they have to grow and the investment performance of the funds that are contributed.&nbsp; This shift of investment responsibility from the employer and reduced cost are the primary reasons these plans have become much more popular with employers than DB Plans. Our focus in this discussion is on the most widely available Defined Contribution Plans.</p>

<p>Profit Sharing Plans are a popular type of plan because they have the greatest employer flexibility. They were initially developed to encourage employees to work hard for the corporation to be profitable, with the expectation that the company would contribute money into the employees&rsquo; accounts when corporate profits were realized. Employer contributions to a Profit Sharing Plan are generally discretionary in that the employer decides if, when, and how much to contribute. Annual contributions are not required.</p>
<p>Compared to Defined Benefit Category Plans, Profit Sharing Plans are relatively inexpensive to set up and administer. Employees bear investment risk in this type of plan since the investment performance of plan assets directly affects the amount of their retirement benefits.&nbsp; As in any qualified plan, pre-tax contributions, growth, and earnings of plan assets are not taxed until withdrawn by the plan participant. Contributions are subject to statutory <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="javascript:;"><strong>limits</strong></a>. Employer contributions are required on a substantial and recurring basis, but not every year.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>A Stock Bonus Plan is very similar to a Profit Sharing Plan, but the participant accounts are invested in stock of the employer company. Employer contributions to the plan are either stocks or contributions of cash that the plan uses to purchase employer stock. These contributions are tax-deductible to the employer.</p>
<p>An ESOP is a type of Stock Bonus Plan. However, an ESOP is designed to allow the ESOP Plan to borrow money from a lending institution. The plan uses the loan proceeds to purchase employer stock. The employer makes tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP Plan (within certain limits), which the ESOP then uses to pay interest and principal on the loan. This enables the employer to borrow funds and repay both principal and interest with tax-deductible dollars.</p>
<p>Employees bear investment risk in these plans since the investment performance of plan assets directly affects the amount of their retirement benefits. ESOPs can broaden stock ownership, which may make takeover more difficult, may incent employees, increase marketability of shares, but may dilute the primary owners&rsquo; ownership percentage.</p>
<p>As in any qualified plan, taxation to the participant of contributions and earnings of plan assets are deferred until withdrawn by the participant. In addition, participants in a Stock Bonus Plan or ESOP can elect net unrealized appreciation treatment with respect to employer securities.</p>
<p>These plans are subject to the same funding and deduction limits as Profit Sharing Plans. Employer contributions are required on a substantial and recurring basis, but not every year.</p>

<h4>Deferral and Matching</h4>
<p>401(k) Plans allow employees to defer compensation into individually designated separate accounts for their retirement. The employees always own (vest in) 100% of their own deferrals and any earnings thereon. If the employer makes matching contributions, there may be a requirement that an employee fulfill a specific period of service before fully vesting in any employer contributions and the earnings thereon.</p>
<p>How about a little free money for your client? If a 401(k) Plan offers matching contributions, the participant should defer at least the amount required to receive the full amount of any employer matching contributions.</p>
<p>The maximum employee deferral is $18,000 (2015) for plan participants under the age of 50. Participants age 50 or more are entitled to an additional $6,000 (2015) deferral. The deferral limit must be <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer12','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>coordinated</strong></a> with deferrals in certain other employer sponsored retirement plans.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Annual additions to a participant&rsquo;s account are limited to the lesser of $53,000 (in 2015, as indexed) or 100% of compensation including all <em>employee</em> deferrals, after-tax <em>employee</em> contributions, <em>employer</em> contributions, and any forfeitures from other participant accounts. The additional deferral for participants age 50 or more increases the limit by $6,000, from $53,000 to $59,000 (2015).<strong></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also a limit, called the covered compensation limit, of $265,000 (2015, as indexed) to the amount of compensation that can be used for purposes of determining <em>employer </em>contributions. <strong></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
The employer's deduction for contributions made to the plan is generally limited to 25% of the covered compensation of all plan participants. Employer contributions are required on a substantial and recurring basis but not every year.

<h4>Net Unrealized Appreciation</h4>
<p>Investment of plan assets into employer stock is more commonly found in 401(k), Profit Sharing, Stock Bonus, and ESOP Plans than in other qualified plans. In 401(k) Plans, it is not uncommon for employers to make matching contributions in employer stock.</p>
<p>If the stock itself (versus cash in lieu of stock) is distributed to a participant, the participant can utilize net unrealized appreciation (NUA) preferential tax treatment. If a qualified plan makes a lump sum distribution that includes employer stock, the unrealized appreciation of the stock (the difference between the value of the stock when contributed to the plan and the value of the stock when distributed) is not taxable to the participant at the time of the distribution as long as two conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The distribution is made after the participant's attainment of age 59&frac12;, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The participant&rsquo;s separation of service from the employer-plan sponsor, or is made posthumously within one year of death.</p>
</li>
</ol>The NUA is subject to income tax at a long-term capital gains rate when the participant actually sells the stock, regardless of how long it is held after the distribution date. Note that the cost basis of the stock is treated as ordinary income at the time of the distribution.

<h4>Solo 401(k) For the Small Business Owner</h4>
<p>What if your small business owner client seeks to establish a qualified plan but is highly averse to cost, complexity, and risk? Be sure you are familiar with an intriguing variation of the 401(k) Plan dubbed the <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer16','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>Solo 401(k)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If your client is open to nonqualified plans as well, consider the SEP IRA and SIMPLE IRA also.</p>

<h4>Solo 401(k)</h4>
<p>This qualified plan may be ideal for the single owner/employee business or a business in which the only two employees are husband and wife. Solo 401(k) Plans may also be referred to in the popular press as &ldquo;Individual 401(k) Plans&rdquo; or &ldquo;Uni-K Plans.&rdquo; The employee may make deferrals and, in addition, the business may make tax-deductible contributions as well. The solo 401(k) Plan is subject to the same contribution limits as the regular 401(k) Plan. Set-up and annual administrative costs are among the lowest of any qualified plan, yet more expensive than related costs of a SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA. Solo 401(k) Plans may also offer the equivalent of Designated Roth Accounts.</p>
