  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Excess Contributions</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>An <em><strong>excess contribution</strong></em> occurs for any year in which IRA contributions exceed the amount allowed. Thus, an excess contribution is an amount that is more than the smaller of:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Taxable compensation, or</li>
    <li>The maximum annual contribution limit ($5,500 for 2016; $6,500 if age 50 or older).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is a 6% annual excise tax penalty on excess contributions to an IRA. This penalty can be avoided if the excess contribution and any earnings attributable to the excess contribution are removed by the due date (including extensions) of the tax return for the year of the contribution.</p>
  <p>If the excess contribution is not removed by the due date of the tax return (including extensions) for the year of the contribution, then it is subject to a 6% penalty for that year and for EACH successive year in which the excess contribution remains in the IRA.</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Excess Contribution Example</h3><p>In May 2016, Sue (age 45) contributed $5,500 to her IRA for 2016, but when the year ended, she only had $4,700 in taxable compensation for the year. Her excess contribution for 2016 is $800. Sue filed an automatic extension of time to file her 2016 Form 1040, which authorizes her to file the 2016 income tax return by October 15, 2017.</p><p>To correct the excess contribution, she must remove the $800 by October 15, 2017. The IRA deduction on her 2016 income tax return will be $4,700, not $5,500. If Sue fails to make this corrective action timely, she will owe a penalty tax of $48 (6% of $800) for 2016 excess contributions.</p>
