<p>The April 2014 Social Security Administration&rsquo;s Basic Facts report discloses that the elderly derive almost four of every ten dollars of their income from Social Security. Ironically, a national survey conducted by the Financial Literacy Center<sup>1</sup> for the Social Security Administration revealed that only 22% of financial advisors feel &ldquo;very knowledgeable&rdquo; about Social Security.</p>
<p>Social Security provides a powerful combination of lifetime payments, federal guarantees, and an inflation-adjusted income stream. The savvy advisor will develop expertise in this foundational retirement income benefit. We will help you develop expertise, and hopefully confidence, in Social Security retirement planning during the accumulation phase by focusing upon these aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and operation of Social Security</li>
<li>Calculating retirement benefits</li>
<li>Avoiding common mistakes</li>
<li>Social Security financial solvency</li>
</ul>
<h4>Design and Operation of Social Security</h4>
<p>Social Security pays benefits, subject to eligibility rules, when a worker retires, becomes disabled, or dies. The worker&rsquo;s spouse, former spouse, and children may also become eligible for benefits when the worker becomes entitled or dies. Understanding retirement benefits is our focus in this course.</p>
<p>Social Security retirement benefits give comfort to clients concerned about outliving their money and the potential ravages of inflation. Under current law, qualifying workers will receive an inflation-adjusted retirement benefit for life, no matter how long they live.</p>
<p>Before a worker can receive retirement benefits, he or she must have credit for a required amount of work in <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>covered employment</strong></a>. Retirement benefits are earned only if a worker is fully insured. A worker is generally fully insured for retirement benefits if he or she has forty <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton2','','show')" href="#_s">credits</a></strong>. Once a worker is fully insured for retirement purposes, he or she remains fully insured for life.</p>
<p>Where does the money to pay benefits come from?&nbsp; Social Security is funded by <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>payroll taxes</strong></a> assessed against employers, employees, and the self-employed.</p>
<p>The Social Security Administration deserves a special call-out for its operational efficiency.&nbsp; For every dollar paid out in benefits in 2013, less than one cent was used to pay administrative expenses according to Social Security&rsquo;s official website in a report entitled, &ldquo;<em>Social Security Administrative Expenses</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Calculating Retirement Benefits</h4>
<p>The size of a client&rsquo;s Social Security retirement check is based on average career earnings and retirement age. The calculation begins with the average, adjusted for inflation, of the highest 35 years of earnings. The average is expressed in monthly terms and is referred to as &ldquo;average indexed monthly earnings&rdquo; (AIME). We will refer to AIME as average earnings in this course. A worker&rsquo;s average earnings are used to calculate their <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton4','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>primary insurance amount (PIA)</strong></a>. A worker&rsquo;s monthly retirement payment may be less than PIA, exactly PIA, or more than PIA based upon the <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layerwbutton5','','show')" href="#_S"><strong>claiming age</strong></a> chosen.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding Common Social Security Mistakes During the Accumulation Period</strong></h3>
<p>Maximizing the future Social Security retirement benefit requires avoiding common mistakes during a client&rsquo;s accumulation period. <strong style="color: #ff0004;">Click each to learn more.</strong></p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>If earnings during any year are zero, that zero becomes part of the average and reduces a worker&rsquo;s retirement benefit. Hence, an able worker should consider working until there are at least 35 years with earnings from covered employment. This is especially true of the primary wage earner in a married couple but may be less impactful for the <a id="clockButton" onclick="toggleClock()" href="#_s"><strong>spouse with lesser earnings</strong></a>.</p>

<h4>Spouse with Lesser Earnings</h4>
<p>A spouse is usually entitled to the greater of his own retirement benefit or up to 50% of his wife&rsquo;s benefit. Consequently, an analysis is required to determine if additional earnings years will actually benefit the spouse with lesser earnings.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Jane has a PIA of $2,000 and is fully insured. Tarzan has a PIA of $800 and is also fully insured. Tarzan has only worked in covered employment for 20 years. When both Jane and Tarzan reach full retirement age, Tarzan will be entitled to a spousal benefit of $1,000 because he is married to Jane. His spousal retirement benefit will be higher than the benefit based upon his individual earnings.</p>
<p>If Tarzan chooses to work additional years in covered employment, he would have to increase his PIA to more than $1,000 to generate a higher retirement income than his spousal benefit as Jane&rsquo;s husband.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Here is an interesting opportunity. Even after all &ldquo;zero&rdquo; years have been replaced by earnings years, there may be even more to gain by continued employment. A worker&rsquo;s average earnings generally increase when a new higher year of earnings replaces an older lower year of inflation-adjusted earnings. Frequently, a late career client may be in their top earnings years and, if so, this strategy could well increase the future monthly retirement benefit check.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The impact of errors or omissions in one&rsquo;s earnings statement is generally minimal if found and corrected early. An annual review of one&rsquo;s Social Security benefit statement is advised. This simple step may avoid real problems 20 or 30 years in the future when records, or even the employer, may be difficult to locate.

<p>Your understanding of these foundational Social Security concepts, such as claiming age and mistakes to avoid, can help your clients in less obvious ways as well. The Pew Research Center&rsquo;s January 13, 2013, <em>Sandwich Generation</em> report discloses that more than 1 in every 5 middle-aged workers provide financial support to a parent. Helping your client&rsquo;s parent make the wisest Social Security choices could indirectly put dollars back into your client&rsquo;s retirement accumulation savings!</p>
<p>There is a final benefit to Social Security that is not to be overlooked. All Social Security payments, including retirement benefits, are indexed annually for inflation through the use of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). There is comfort in the COLA for clients concerned about maintaining purchasing power.</p>
<h4>Social Security Financial Solvency</h4>
<p>Will you receive your promised benefits from Social Security? This visceral worry may be on the hearts and minds of many, if not most, of your clients as they read predictions of doom and gloom in the headlines. Join us as we separate fear from fact.</p>

<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
<p>Complete insolvency is unlikely because of the very nature of Social Security. At its core, Social Security is a system of inter-generational wealth transfer through taxation. Every generation pays for the previous generation&rsquo;s benefits through payroll taxes. As long as this nation has individuals working in covered employment, there will be a source of funding for Social Security benefit payments. <strong></strong></p>
<p>The Social Security Administration reports in its <em>Summary of the 2013 Annual Reports</em>, that until 2010, annual payroll taxes collected were more than annual benefits paid. The difference was invested in specialized Treasury bonds owned by the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund.</p>
<p>The report further asserts that since 2010, more benefits were paid annually than taxes collected. The funding for the difference comes from the Trust Fund. The report also notes that, even if the current structure is not reformed, 100% of promised benefits will be paid through 2033 and approximately 75% of promised benefits will be paid from 2034 through 2087.</p>
</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>What, then, are the planning implications for your clients? There are at least three potential responses: 1) assume everything will be fixed by Congress and that 100% of expected benefits will be paid; 2) assume the worst case and no benefits will be paid; or 3) strike a middle ground by assuming most, but not all, promised benefits will be paid. While an argument could be made for choice 3, ultimately your client&rsquo;s wishes will drive which of these choices is most appropriate.</p>
<p>Our purpose in this Social Security discussion is to help raise awareness of these issues rather than to suggest specific client recommendations. Clients may present differing goals, life expectancies, income tax rates, and earnings histories. Social Security regulations and tax laws are subject to change. Hence, specific client questions should be directed to the Social Security Administration, an attorney, CPA, or CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professional.</p>

<h4>Covered Employment</h4>
<p>If Social Security and Medicare taxes are being withheld from your client&rsquo;s paycheck, then their employment is covered employment. The following types of employment are not covered employment and hence, Social Security taxes are not withheld and the workers are not eligible for Social Security benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Railroad workers with their own retirement system outside of Social Security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal government employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes because they participate in a separate retirement system outside of Social Security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State and local governments may opt out of Social Security and establish separate retirement plans for their employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clergy may opt out of Social Security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
Noteworthy - Self-employment is also generally considered covered employment.

<p>A credit<strong></strong>is also frequently and mistakenly referred to as a quarter of coverage. This can be confusing because a worker may earn four credits in the first quarter of the year.

<h4>Payroll Taxes</h4>
<p>Employees pay Social Security taxes of 6.2% on compensation from covered employment up to a certain limit. That limit is called the taxable wage base. The taxable wage base is $118,500 in 2015, as indexed. Here is an interesting observation - the taxable wage base has increased four times faster than inflation since the first taxable wage base was set at $3,000 in 1937.</p>
<p>Employees also pay a Medicare tax of 1.45% of ALL compensation without limit. While our focus is not Medicare in this discussion, you should know how these taxes are assessed. A new tax - the 0.9% Medicare Surtax - is also payable by the employee on earned income in excess of certain thresholds. Employers are required to match the 6.2% Social Security tax and the 1.45% Medicare tax withheld from employees. Employers do not match the 0.9% Medicare Surtax.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Anita Advisor earned $160,000 in 2015 as an employee of a national financial services firm. Remember that the Social Security taxable wage base is $118,500 (2015, as indexed). Anita will have $9,574 withheld from her pay as the following calculation illustrates.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$7,347 Social Security tax (6.2% of $118,500)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$2,320 Medicare tax (1.45% of 160,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$9,667 Total Social Security and Medicare Tax Withheld</p>
</li>
</ul>
Anita&rsquo;s employer must match this $9,667 and will send a check to IRS for $19,334. Her earned income is such that she is not subject to the 0.9% Medicare Surtax.</td>

<p>Self-employed workers are both employee and employer. Hence, the self-employed have the dubious distinction of paying both the employee and employer portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes. The self-employed receive an income tax deduction for the employer portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)</h4>
<p>A worker is not paid 100% of her average earnings when she retires. Average earnings are reduced through a formula to develop a worker&rsquo;s PIA. The PIA is biased in favor of those with relatively lower earnings.</p>
<p>A deep dive into the PIA calculation is beyond the scope of this course. However, you should know that the largest percentage increases to PIA come from the bottom end of average earnings. For example, 90% of the first $826 (2015, as indexed) in average earnings per month is added to PIA, but only 15% of average earnings per month above $4,980 (2015, as indexed) is added to PIA. Average earnings above the taxable wage base ($118,500 in 2015) add nothing to PIA.</p>

<h4>Claiming Age</h4>
<p>The age at which a worker applies for retirement benefits is the worker&rsquo;s claiming age. A worker has three choices: 1) claim early and take a permanently reduced benefit; 2) claim on time at normal retirement age (age 65 to 67 depending upon year of birth) and receive a benefit of 100% of PIA; or 3) delay claiming and receive a permanently increased benefit.</p>

<p>Early - A worker may claim no earlier than age 62. Workers claiming at age 62 incur a permanent reduction from their PIA. Workers claiming after age 62 but before their normal retirement age will have their retirement benefit reduced for each month they claim early based upon a formula. A worker retiring at age 62 will incur a 20% reduction if their normal retirement age is 65 and a 30% reduction if their normal retirement age is age 67.</p>
