  </h1>
  <p>Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Arrangements (NQDCAs) are typically implemented by employers to provide tax-advantaged deferred benefits to supplement existing retirement benefits for a select group of employees/executives. </p>
  <p>NQDCAs may be characterized by the following:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>NQDCAs are not restricted by ERISA requirements applicable to qualified retirement plans; thus, they can offer more flexibility to employers in terms of plan design.</li>
	<li>An NQDCA allows the employee to defer a certain portion of his/her compensation to a later date, thereby also deferring the income tax liability on the compensation. </li>
	<li>Employer contributions may also be made to NQDCAs without restriction by qualified plan limits.</li>
	<li>Any earnings/growth in the value of the deferred amount is also not taxed to the employee until he or she receives the funds. Thus, the NQDCA allows the employee to leverage the investment return on their compensation and time receipt of compensation when it is more advantageous or specifically needed, i.e., to supplement retirement income.</li>
	<li>The employer can deduct the amount of compensation deferred only when it is ultimately paid to the employee.</li>
  </ul>

 </div></p>
  <p>The employee’s NQDCA account does not have the security of the protection offered by a qualified plan. Payment to the employee generally depends on the sustainability of the employer’s business. In the event of employer bankruptcy, an employee’s NQDCA balance is generally treated as that of an unsecured creditor.</p>
