  <p>Conventional wisdom holds that current and future income tax rates should be the driver in deciding between Roth and non-Roth contributions during the accumulation period. Conventional wisdom is not wrong; however, it may be superficial. There are other valuable and unique Roth IRA planning opportunities seldom appreciated by advisors much less articulated to clients.</p>
  <p>Each of the three unique opportunities discussed below have a common theme – saving money by reducing a client’s adjusted gross income through Roth IRA distributions. Click each opportunity to learn more.</p>
  <!--Add Moving Table here-->
  <p>Our goal in this discussion is to raise your awareness rather than bog you down with the details of every possible permutation of the foregoing opportunities. The scope of this course does not permit an exhaustive presentation of all tax, Social Security, and Medicare variables that may apply to your client’s individual situation. We encourage consultation with your in-house experts before making specific recommendations to clients. In addition, your client should consult their CFP® Certificant, CPA or professional tax advisor before any planning decisions are made.</p>
