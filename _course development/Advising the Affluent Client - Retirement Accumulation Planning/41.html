  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Pre-Retirement Distributions from Qualified Plans</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Distributions to a qualified plan participant who is still employed by the sponsor and still participating in the sponsor’s qualified plan are called <strong>in-service withdrawals</strong>.  The qualified plan administrator is generally required to withhold 20% for taxes from the amount of the in-service withdrawal, unless the distribution is transferred to an eligible retirement plan by means of a direct rollover.</p>
  <p>In general, Defined Benefit, Cash Balance, Target Benefit, and Money Purchase retirement plans do not permit in-service withdrawals before age 62. Other qualified plans may allow in-service withdrawals.  The table below identifies which retirement plans may allow in-service withdrawals. In many cases, the plans are not required to offer in-service withdrawals, merely permitted to do so. Your client should check with the plan administrator to determine availability of in-service withdrawals.</p>

&lt;p&gt;In-service withdrawal of pre-tax and Roth deferrals are only allowed for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attainment of age 59½&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to disability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to a &lt;span style=&quot;color:#af6f29; font-weight: 600&quot;;&gt;hardship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Hardship&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In order to qualify for a hardship withdrawal, the participant must have an immediate and heavy financial need (such as for medical expenses, college tuition payments, purchase of a primary residence, or prevention of eviction).  The participant must have also exhausted all other reasonable resources, including loans and distributions from qualified and nonqualified plans.  
Remember that hardship withdrawals are subject to the 10% premature distribution penalty unless they meet one of the specific penalty exceptions covered subsequently in this course.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-service withdrawal of employer contributions may be distributed for any of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employer contributions have been in the account for two years &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attainment of age 59½&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardship&lt;/li&gt;

<p>The entire in-service distribution from a qualified plan will generally be taxable as ordinary income.  In-service withdrawals from qualified plans or Section 403(b) Plans may also be subject to a premature distribution penalty of 10% of the taxable amount withdrawn, although there are various exceptions to the 10% premature distribution penalty, as discussed on the next page.</p>
