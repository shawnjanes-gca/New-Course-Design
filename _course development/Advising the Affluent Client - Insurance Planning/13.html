  <p>Term life insurance has <strong>no cash value</strong> and offers <strong>no savings or investment benefit</strong>. But it does provide a <strong>death benefit</strong> if death occurs during a stated period of time (typically a year). That makes it the most basic and least expensive type of life insurance available. Term life insurance is usually issued in one of the forms listed below. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each form to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>Term insurance can be underwritten to be <em>renewable</em>, or not renewable, at the end of the initial &quot;term period,&quot; e.g., at the end of five years. It may be renewable conditionally, based on the health status and insurability of the insured, or guaranteed renewable, regardless of the health status or insurability of the insured.</p>
              <p>Some policies will have two sets of guaranteed renewable rates: one for those who provide new evidence of insurability at each renewal date, and a higher schedule of rates for those who do not (or cannot). In either case, the premiums will increase at each renewal period as the insured gets older. Term policies are often renewable to about age 70, although many policies are renewable to about age 100. Including the right to renew a term policy increases the cost of coverage. </p>

              <p>A term policy may or may not include the right to <strong><em>convert </em></strong>the term policy to a &quot;permanent&quot; or whole life policy without evidence of insurability.

              <p>The vast majority of term insurance written is <strong><em>level term</em></strong>; this means that the death benefit remains the same throughout the term of the policy. The premium is level throughout the term. <strong><em>Decreasing term </em></strong>policies have a scheduled decrease in the death benefit and are occasionally used to provide coverage for loans and mortgages. The premium is level throughout the term. Increasing term policies, where the death benefit increases throughout the term, are underwritten by just a few companies and have an increasing death benefit and premium throughout the term.</p>

              <p>The initial premiums of term life insurance are generally less than those of permanent life insurance. That makes it more affordable for younger clients with limited funds. It also makes it the better choice when the need for life insurance is for a short, limited time, as might be the case when required to have term insurance before receiving approval on a loan.</p>

              <p>But over time, term insurance premiums typically increase as the policy is renewed for the same amount of coverage. Permanent insurance is issued with a level premium that is higher than term insurance when issued at a given age, but becomes less expensive than term insurance as the insured ages.</p>
              <p>Thus, the appeal of low initial premiums must be balanced against the fact that premiums of term life insurance will be higher in later years. Where the need for life insurance is long-term, total cost of insurance may be less with permanent insurance. It is also important to keep in mind that one's insurability might decline over the years, and coverage might eventually be lost with term insurance when it could have been retained with permanent insurance. </p>
