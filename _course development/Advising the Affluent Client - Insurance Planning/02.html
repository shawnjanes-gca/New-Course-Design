  <p>Most people are hesitant in addressing issues associated with their own mortality and frailty.  That is why so many people die without ever having executed a will.  It is also why people can be slow to address their life-related insurance needs.  In fact, it may be even more of an issue when it comes to insurance because it usually requires an ongoing expense for which they may never realize a financial benefit.</p>
  <p> This is why it is not sufficient that you alone see the insurable risk in your clients' lives; they must also see it and must feel motivated to find a solution.  This won't happen simply by informing them that they have an insurable risk for which you have a solution.  Your clients will simply thank you for the information and promise to consider it later.  Instead, you must guide them to reflect on the risk for themselves; you must get them to open their mind's eye and confront the consequences that they generally prefer to leave out of sight.</p>

  	<h3>Insight on Accomplishing This Task</h3>
  	<p>The best way to accomplish this is to ask questions, not make statements.  In this process, avoid asking closed-ended questions that can be answered with a "Yes" or "No."  These questions require no real thought and therefore never get the client to begin contemplating inner feelings and concerns.  Rather, ask open-ended questions that cause the client to reflect on his or her current situation.  Such questions typically begin with "How" and are process-oriented. They make the client think through the process of resolving the situation you propose.  By asking focused open-ended questions, you can assist your clients in reflecting upon the inadequacies of their current planning, or lack thereof, and help them become more motivated to resolve the consequences that they see for themselves.
We are not suggesting that you do this in a manipulative way.  Far from it!  We are simply pointing out that when it comes to issues like death and disability, no one likes to reflect on these.  So, you have a choice.  You can skirt around the risk issues you see in your client's situation and allow your client to continue feeling comfortable; or you can ask some carefully worded questions that might create some momentary discomfort, but are more likely to motivate your client to face their life-related financial risks and seek a solution.</p>
		<div class="explanation-widget-box">
      	<p>Therefore, when you recognize a need for which you can offer a solution, begin asking questions like these:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>How have you planned to provide for the security of your family if you should prematurely die?</li>
         	<li>How have you planned to ensure that your wife doesn't have to return to work and place your children in day-care if you should become disabled?</li>
         	<li>How have you planned so that your wife will have the liquidity she needs to take care of your family, rather than being left with a business she neither knows how to manage nor how to sell?</li>
        	<li>How have you protected your children's college savings from being wiped out by the costs of a long-term recovery from an illness or injury?</li>
        </ul>
