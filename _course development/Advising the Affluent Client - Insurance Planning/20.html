  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Investment Return in Universal Policies</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Because the purchaser of a Universal policy bears some of the interest rate risk, Universal policies are typically less expensive than Whole Life coverage and the interest rate is typically higher. Should market rates increase significantly, the rate in the Universal policy might also increase, making it possible to reduce the premium payments. Of course, premiums could also increase if rates decline.</p>
  <p> It is also worth noting that a return within an insurance policy is tax-deferred. This can make a Universal policy appealing. And as shown in the preceding illustration, it is possible to have a sizeable amount of funds earning tax-deferred interest. </p>
  <p> Note that Universal Life insurance policies are subject to the Modified Endowment Contract limits discussed previously. </p>
