<p>In contrast to term life insurance, permanent life insurance offers two key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifetime coverage </strong>- Not just for a specified term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Surrender Value (CSV)</strong> - Supplements life insurance coverage by accumulating the invested funds (less fees and expenses) as a cash value. If the policy owner chooses to terminate the policy at any point, it should be noted that the CSV would be less than the premium payments put into the policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Three Types of Permanent Life Insurance</h4>
<p>In the last thirty years, policy owners demanded more flexibility of premium payments and policy design, as well as a willingness to assume the rewards and risks of directing the investment allocation of policy cash values. This has resulted in a variety of new policy designs. The three that are by far the most popular are listed below:</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Traditional whole life insurance provides lifetime insurance coverage with premiums that do not increase over time (a guaranteed level premium rate). The policy also builds cash value (surrender value), which are accessible to the policyowner by loan, surrender, can be annuitized, or can be used to purchase paid-up insurance, or to purchase term insurance for an extended period of time.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This type of insurance unbundles the pricing factors of the policy; therefore, it may provide the purchaser with more flexibility regarding payment of premiums and face amounts.</p>
<p>Universal Life can be maintained without cash value as long as the premiums are sufficient to cover the mortality and administration expense. If the policy has cash value sufficient to pay the mortality charges and expenses, then premiums can generally be paid at the will of the owner.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This type of insurance allows the purchaser to assume full investment risk of the policy. The owner can allocate premiums among a number of funds, and the death benefit and cash value will vary with the performance of those funds.</p>

<p>While there are certainly variations of these three types, with some policies combining elements of more than one type, all permanent policies essentially are contained within these three types. The following pages will discuss each of them in some detail.</p>
