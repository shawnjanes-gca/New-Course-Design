  <p>In contrast to term life insurance, Permanent Life insurance offers two key benefits: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Lifetime coverage </strong>-      Not just for a specified term. </li>
    <li><strong>Cash Surrender Value      (CSV)</strong> - Supplements life insurance coverage by accumulating the      invested funds (less fees and expenses) as a cash value.Â  If the policy owner chooses to terminate      the policy at any point, it should be noted that the CSV would be less      than the premium payments put into the policy. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Types of Permanent Life Insurance  </h3>
  <p>  Policy owners have the greatest selection of policy types as a result of the evolution of these policies to meet needs for more flexibility of premium payments as well as a desire to direct the investment allocation of policy cash values. This has resulted in a variety of new policy designs to supplement Traditional Whole Life. The four most popular types of Permanent Life insurance are listed below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span>Traditional Whole Life</span></li>
    <li><span>Universal Life</span></li>
    <li><span>Variable Life</span></li>
    <li><span>Variable Universal Life</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p>While there are certainly variations of these types, with some policies combining elements of more than one type, all Permanent Life policies essentially are contained within these four types. The following pages will discuss each of them in some detail.</p>
