  <p>Insurance purchases should be coordinated with other financial planning decisions.  That's not typically how it happens, however.  Unlike investment decisions, our clients are not inclined to evaluate and compare, but rather to purchase from convenience.  The result is that most people's insurance portfolio is disconnected from the remainder of their financial lives.</p>
  <p> As an advisor, your role is to demonstrate the value of a more structured and disciplined approach to making these decisions.  To fully provide service as a trusted advisor, you must first consider the impact of each interrelated decision. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each decision point below to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>A disciplined, structured wealth management process is fundamental to providing advice for clients.  Any client and advisor who would make the effort to agree to an Investment Policy and Asset Allocation should incorporate insurance planning as part of the process.  If insurance planning is managed outside of the guidelines, the concept may be weakened as a result.</p>

              <p>Since permanent insurance builds cash value on a tax-deferred basis and many policies offer options to access the cash value in tax-favored methods, e.g., policy loans, taxation must be considered in conjunction with the insurance decision.  The client's current tax bracket is relevant to any decision to utilize the cash value of a policy, and their expected future tax bracket should be considered when determining withdrawal strategy. </p>

              <p>Once an advisor understands a client's goals, the priority of those goals must be considered.  For example, over-insured persons with insufficient retirement assets might consider their advisory relationship to be less than adequate, as they have not been given proper counsel regarding their retirement planning because the advisor focused solely on the sale of insurance.  Conversely, someone might save toward their children's education and fail to retire as a result of the death of their spouse.</p>
