  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Understanding Insurance Products</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Having gained some insight into the financial lifecycle, the objectives and needs that are common in each stage of the lifecycle, and the insurance solutions that are relevant to them, we now turn to a more in-depth analysis of the insurance products that are used to deliver those solutions.   We will begin by exploring the various types of life insurance that are available and some of the features that can be tailored to meet specific situations.  This will be followed by a study of disability and long-term care insurance.</p>
