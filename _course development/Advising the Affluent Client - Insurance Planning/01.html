<p>We all live with certain financial risks associated with our own mortality and human frailty. Death, Disability, and Long-Term Care: these can have a very significant financial impact in our lives, and we need ways to minimize that exposure. Insurance provides a way to manage those risks.</p>
<p>Highly adaptable to individual needs, it is much more a financial planning tool than it is a product. For its proper use, the financial advisors should begin with the human needs under consideration, and then ask if insurance is a viable solution. This is precisely the process that will be presented on the following pages.</p>

<h4>Objectives and Course Structure</h4>
<p>This course focuses on the financial risks associated with death, disability, and long-term care. Within that context, its objective is to equip you to help clients address their most common insurance planning needs. These are listed on the right.</p>
<p>As each need is presented, guidance will be provided regarding the approach to take with the client. In particular, the course will address how to help the client <strong><em>see</em></strong> the need and <strong><em>desire</em></strong> a solution. The methodology for accomplishing this will be addressed on the next page, and then illustrated on the following pages as we address each of the five common insurance planning needs.</p>
