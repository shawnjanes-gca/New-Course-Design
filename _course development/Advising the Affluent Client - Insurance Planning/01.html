  <p>We all live with certain financial risks associated with our own mortality and human frailty.   Death, Disability, and Long-Term Care: these can have a very significant financial impact in our lives, and we need ways to minimize that exposure.  Insurance provides a way to manage those risks.</p>
  <p>Highly adaptable to individual needs, it is much more a financial planning tool than it is a product. For its proper use, the financial advisors should begin with the human needs under consideration, and then ask if insurance is a viable solution. This is precisely the process that will be presented on the following pages.</p>
  <h3>Course Structure</h3>
  <p>This course focuses on the financial risks associated with death, disability, and long-term care.  Within that context, its objective is to equip you to help clients address their most common insurance planning needs.  These are listed on the right.</p>
  <p>As each need is presented, guidance will be provided regarding the approach to take with the client.  In particular, the course will address how to help the client <em><strong>see</strong></em> the need and <em><strong>desire</strong></em> a solution.  The methodology for accomplishing this will be addressed on the next page, and then illustrated on the following pages as we address each of the five common insurance planning needs.</p>
