              <p>The client's circumstances should be considered as primary decision factors.  This would include issues such as:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>How long will the need exist?</strong> This factor could      influence the choice of term versus permanent insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Does the client have the ability to save money without forced      savings?</strong>  If not, a permanent      form of insurance with cash value might make more sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Does the client have a preference as to type of life insurance?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What is the purpose of the coverage?</strong>  Estate planning would likely indicate a      need for permanent coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Is cost an issue, relative to the client's other goals?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What is the insurability of the person?</strong> </li>

<p>We also conclude that with some awareness questions, you can help your client or prospect recognize the need for considering the types of insurance needed and enhance the perceived value you are adding by addressing them.</p>
<div class="three-key-questions">
  <h3>Awareness Questions</h3>
  <p>Below are example questions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>How did your advisor determine the appropriate type of insurance for you to own?</span></li>
    <li><span>What process did your advisor use to identify the amount of risk you face in relation to your goals?</span></li>
    <li><span>What process guided your decisions about the type or amount of insurance you have?</span></li>
