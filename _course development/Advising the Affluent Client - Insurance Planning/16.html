<h2>Modifications to Traditional Whole Life Insurance</h2>

<p>While most people purchase life insurance for a set amount on one individual, an alternative known as <em><strong>modified amount coverage </strong></em>is also possible. Recognizing that as people age, their need for life insurance typically decreases; this alternative will modify the amount of coverage downward as the insured ages. Since coverage decreases over time, premiums are less, making this type of coverage more affordable.</p>

<p><strong>Reaping the Benefits of Favorable Markets</strong></p>
<p>To meet demand for sharing in the benefit of an investment windfall,<strong> Interest-Sensitive Whole Life Insurance</strong>, also known as <strong>"Current Assumption Whole Life Insurance,"</strong> was developed.</p>
<p>Such policies allow the premium rate to change if assumptions regarding mortality should change or if investment return or expenses are different than what was projected. Alternatively, if investment return is greater than was expected or expenses less, then premiums can be held constant and cash value will become greater than the guaranteed amount.</p>
<p>In short, such policies result in a limited sharing in the risk and potential return of the market's and insurer's performance, and somewhat bridge the gap between traditional whole life policies and more recent policies that provide greater opportunity for enhanced return.</p>
