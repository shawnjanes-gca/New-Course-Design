<h1><span class="pagetitle">Life Insurance as a Solution for Long-Term Care</span> <!-- pagetitle --></h1>
<p>Though not generally regarded as a way to plan for long-term care, life insurance policies can provide benefits in a similar manner to long-term care insurance.&nbsp; The accelerated death benefit provision and single premium policies are two ways to accomplish paying for long-term care.</p>
<p>Life insurance policies may also have potential value in, at least partially, covering LTC expenses.&nbsp; This may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the following:</p>
<ol style="width: 95%;">
<li><span>A policy may contain an <strong><em>Accelerated Benefits Rider</em></strong> or allow the policy owner to "negotiate" accelerated benefits directly with the life insurance company under certain conditions, such as diagnosis of a terminal illness, diagnosis of certain medical conditions, need for LTC, or confinement to a nursing home.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Receipt of these accelerated benefits is generally income tax-free and often can leave a balance in the life policy to be paid at death. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>A <strong><em>Viatical Settlement</em></strong> may be a viable option if an Accelerated Benefits Rider is not available. Unlike Accelerated Benefit Riders, Viatical Settlements are <strong>not regulated in all states</strong> and an enhanced level of due diligence should be taken to assure fair pricing of a settlement that usually ranges from 50% to 80% of the current death benefit of the policy.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Typically, the insured will need to be terminal &ndash; expected to die within 12 to 24 months.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>If the life insurance policy has a cash value, it can be surrendered, withdrawn, or borrowed against. This may not be a sufficient source of cash.</span></li>
<li><span>If life insurance coverage is no longer needed, certain life insurance policies with cash value may be eligible for a tax-deferred (or tax-free) exchange to a long-term care policy. It is generally necessary to complete the exchange before an illness or injury requires long-term care.</span></li>
<li><span>Borrow funds, possibly from a family member, by transferring ownership to the lender or use the life insurance policy as collateral assignment to cover the loan and interest. </span>
<ul>
<li><span>If the ownership is transferred, this will also relieve the terminal client of premium payment obligations. Keep in mind, however, that life insurance transferred within 3 years of death is includable in the transferring owner's estate for estate tax purposes.</span></li>
<li><span>Note also that if the insured is under age 65, a Waiver of Premium Rider may be attached to the policy, which typically pays premiums during disability to age 65.</span></li>
</ul>
