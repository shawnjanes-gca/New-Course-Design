<p>Though not generally regarded as a way to plan for long-term care, life insurance policies can provide benefits in a similar manner to long-term care insurance. The accelerated death benefit provision and single premium policies are two ways to accomplish paying for long-term care.</p>
<p>Life insurance policies may also have potential value in, at least partially, covering LTC expenses. This is accomplished in four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A policy may contain an <strong><em>Accelerated Benefits Rider</em></strong> or allow the policyowner to "negotiate" accelerated benefits under certain conditions, such as diagnosis of a terminal illness, diagnosis of certain medical conditions, need for LTC, or confinement to a nursing home. Receipt of these accelerated benefits is generally income tax-free and often can leave a balance in the life policy to be paid at death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong><em>Viatical Settlement</em></strong> may be a viable option. Unlike Accelerated Benefit Riders, Viatical Settlements are not regulated in all states and more care should be taken to assure fair pricing of a settlement which usually ranges from 50% to 80% of the current death benefit of the policy. Typically, the insured will need to be terminal - expected to die within 12 to 24 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the policies have cash value, they can be surrendered, withdrawn, or borrowed against. This is typically not a sufficient source of cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Borrow funds, possibly from a family member, by transferring ownership to the lender or use the policy as collateral assignment to cover the loan and interest. If the ownership is transferred, this will also relieve the terminal client of premium payment obligations. Keep in mind, however, that life insurance transferred within 3 years of death is includable in the transferring owner's estate for estate tax purposes. Note also that if the insured is under age 65, a Waiver of Premium Rider may be attached to the policy, which typically pays premiums during disability to age 65.</p>
</li>
