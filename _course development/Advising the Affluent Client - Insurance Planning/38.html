  <p>Thinking of your client's insurance decisions as another carefully planned portfolio designed to protect their loved ones and their financial goals, and not as commodity transactions, is central to becoming the client's primary source of financial counsel.  The knowledge you have gained in this course will help you achieve that goal.</p>
  <p> As you seek to address the insurance needs of your clients, a good place to start is with helping the client identify clear risk management objectives.  Most clients will possess policies that were obtained more out of convenience or circumstance, than as the result of a well-thought-out strategy.  They have coverage merely because their employer provides it or merely because it was a product that someone "sold" them.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  <p>You can differentiate yourself by helping the client work through a systematic process that addresses the following issues:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Identification of the      types of risk the client deems relevant to his or her financial life</li>
      <li>Quantifying the coverage      needed to address those risks</li>
      <li>Identifying the time      horizon around those risks, e.g. current vs. retirement vs. at death </li>
      <li>Identifying a portfolio of insurance products that address those risks  </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>By taking a systematic, holistic approach to identifying and resolving the client's insurance risk needs, you will take a significant step in becoming or maintaining your status as the client's trusted advisor.</p>
