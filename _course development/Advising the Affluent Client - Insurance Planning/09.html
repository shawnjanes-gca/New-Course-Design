  <p>For each of these stages, insurance can help manage the risk and provide potential infusion of cash at critical junctures. It can also help them accomplish life goals, such as preserving the value of an estate for children. Listed below are some insurance solutions that may be relevant at each stage of the financial lifecycle. These solutions are discussed in more detail in subsequent training modules. You should be familiar with the basic definition of each and understand how each can be applied to manage the risks and objectives associated with each stage of the financial lifecycle.</p>

                <p>Universal Life policies accumulate wealth through the growth of the cash value account during life or a death benefit paid at the insured's death. The insurance company selects the investments in the cash value account.</p>
                <p> Universal Life is permanent life insurance and is described by the following features:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Within limits, the policy      owner can adjust the amount of the premiums paid, as well as the premium-paying      period. </li>
                  <li>Within certain      underwriting guidelines, the death benefits can be adjusted without      requiring issue of a new policy. </li>
                  <li>Interest on the cash value      is tax-deferred and has a guaranteed minimum, but can fluctuate with      market conditions. Alternatively, some Universal Life policies offer a      guaranteed death benefit for those clients who are not generally      interested in policy cash value.</li>
                  <li>Partial withdrawals can be      made from the policy's cash value without incurring a policy loan (unlike      a whole life policy). </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Funding a Universal Life policy with flexible premium payments is analogous to keeping enough gas in your car to keep the car running. </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>If premium payments are      insufficient to maintain the administrative and mortality charges in the      policy, the premiums will need to be increased significantly to "catch-up"      with current and future charges and/or the death benefit will need to be      decreased. </li>
                  <li>If neither of these      adjustments is done or is insufficient, the policy will lapse.</li>

                  <li>Over time, this type of      insurance can provide better investment returns than traditional whole      life policies and may be a preferred means of tax-deferred savings. </li>

                <p>Variable Life policies hold the potential, <strong>but not the guarantee</strong>, of greater wealth accumulation in the cash value account through selection from a menu of different funds. </p>

                <p>Survivorship or Second-to-Die life insurance is a joint-life policy that pays the death benefit when the second of two insured individuals dies. </p>
                <p> These policies offer premiums that are less than the cost of two individual life insurance policies and are commonly used to fund estate settlement expenses at the death of a second spouse.</p>
                <p>This insurance may be issued as term, but more often it is issued as whole life or universal life insurance policies due to the long-term nature of the risk. </p>
