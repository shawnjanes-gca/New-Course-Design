<p>For each of these stages, insurance can help manage the risk and provide potential infusion of cash at critical junctures. It can also help them accomplish life goals, such as preserving the value of an estate for children. Listed below are some insurance solutions that may be relevant at each stage of the financial lifecycle. These solutions are discussed in more detail in subsequent training modules. You should be familiar with the basic definition of each and understand how each can be applied to manage the risks and objectives associated with each stage of the financial lifecycle.</p>

<p>Term Life is life insurance that has no cash value and pays benefits only if death occurs during a stated term of time (typically a year). Premiums are initially lower than permanent life insurance, making it more affordable for younger people.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_3" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Universal Life is permanent life insurance that is characterized by the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within limits, the policy owner can vary the amount of the premiums paid, as well as the premium-paying period.</li>
<li>Within certain underwriting guidelines, the death benefits can be adjusted without requiring issue of a new policy.</li>
<li>Interest on the cash value is tax-deferred and has a guaranteed minimum, but can vary with market conditions. Alternatively, some Universal Life policies offer a guaranteed death benefit for those clients who are not generally interested in policy cash value.</li>
<li>Partial withdrawals can be made from the policy's cash value without incurring a policy loan (unlike a whole life policy).</li>
</ul>
<p>Funding a Universal Life policy with flexible premium payments is analogous to keeping enough gas in your car to keep the car running. If premium payments are insufficient to maintain the administrative and mortality charges in the policy, the premiums will need to be increased significantly to "catch-up" with current and future charges and/or the death benefit will need to be decreased. If neither of these adjustments is done or is insufficient, the policy will lapse.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_4" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Variable Life is permanent life insurance where the investment risk is shifted to the owner of the policy. The owner can allocate the accumulated funds among separate accounts, each with different investment objectives. Both the death benefit AND cash value of the policy will fluctuate based on the investment performance of these funds. Over time, this type of insurance can provide better investment returns than traditional whole life policies and may be a preferred means of tax-deferred savings. Because the owner is assuming the investment risk, the SEC has determined that these policies are investment vehicles and must be sold by licensed broker/dealers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_5" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Disability insurance provides income when the insured cannot work due to sickness or injury. The amount of coverage available is usually restricted to 60 to 80 percent of current gross earnings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_6" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>First-to-Die insurance is a joint-life policy that pays the death benefit when the first of a small number of insured individuals die. Such policies can be issued as term, whole life, or universal life insurance policies. These policies offer premiums that are less than the cost of individual life insurance policies, and can be useful where both spouses work and need protection against loss of income if one spouse dies. These policies are also commonly used to fund buy-sell agreements.</p>
