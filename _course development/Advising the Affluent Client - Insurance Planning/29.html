<p><strong>Benefit Amounts</strong></p>
<p>Benefits for long-term care insurance should be thought of in terms of "daily" and "maximum" amounts. Two common options available are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Daily benefits of $50, $100, $150, or $200 paid out over a maximum of two, three, or six years, or over the insured's lifetime. In some policies, the daily benefit and benefit period may also be multiplied to determine a maximum lifetime benefit, which is more attractive when benefits received are less than the daily benefit such as in limited assisted living care.</p>
</li>
<li>A "per diem" policy that pays out a lifetime maximum benefit, such as $150 daily and a $350,000 lifetime limit. Sometimes these policies will pay a flat amount per day regardless of the costs incurred</li>
</ul>
<p>These amounts are applied to the cost of care for the insured. On the following pages, we will look at the different types of care that are available.</p>

<p>Having discussed disability insurance, we now turn our attention to long-term care insurance. <strong><em>Long-term care</em></strong> (LTC) refers to the medical and custodial services used by Americans who have disabilities or chronic illnesses. These services involve very personal care, but they can also include the skilled care of a doctor, nurse, or physical therapist. Because of the personal service nature of long-term care, the costs are not picked up by conventional group or individual plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Medicare, Medicaid, and Long-Term Care</h4>
<p>Long-term care is sometimes confused with Medicare and Medicaid, which are government programs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Medicare</em></strong> is the Federal health care program for individuals age 65 or older, or individuals with a disability. It is divided into two parts. Part A covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice care. Part B covers reasonable and necessary medical services such as doctors' services, outpatient hospital care, home health care, and medical supplies, among other things.</p>

<h4>Eligibility for Long-Term Care</h4>
<p>There are two approaches to determining when a client is eligible to receive benefits from a long-term care policy: inability to perform the activities of daily living and cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>Eligibility for long-term care is often regulated by the number of ADLs that are violated. Benefits are paid if the insured cannot perform a certain number (depends on the policy) of these functions. Required ADLs usually include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dressing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bathing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transferring (e.g., moving from bed to chair)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toileting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grooming/personal hygiene</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking/ambulating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobility inside the home</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically,<strong> </strong>a licensed health care practitioner must certify that the need for assistance with the ADLs is reasonably expected to continue for at least 90 days.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw2_2">
<div id="p7ABc2_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Cognitive impairment involves the deterioration or loss in intellectual capacity causing impairment in some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Short- and long-term memory loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of orientation to people, places, and time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of deductive or abstract reasoning (including judgment)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deficiencies in cognitive function are reflected in inability to perform certain instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) which typically include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shopping for personal items</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the telephone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparing meals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing medication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing housework</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits payable upon activation of cognitive impairment begins when the individual has been certified to require substantial supervision to protect himself or herself from threats to health and safety due to cognitive impairment.</p>
