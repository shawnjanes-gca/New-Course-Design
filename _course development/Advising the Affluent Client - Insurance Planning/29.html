    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Having discussed disability insurance, we now turn our attention to long-term care insurance.  <strong><em>Long-term care</em></strong> (LTC) refers to the medical and custodial services used by Americans who have disabilities or chronic illnesses.  These services involve very personal care, but they can also include the skilled care of a doctor, nurse, or physical therapist.  Because of the personal service nature of long-term care, the costs are not picked up by most commercial group health care or individual health care plans.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3><strong>Benefit Amounts</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Benefits for long-term care insurance should be thought of in terms of "daily" and "maximum" amounts.  Two common options available are:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Daily benefits of $50,      $100, $150, $200 or more paid out over a maximum of two, three, or six      years, or over the insured's lifetime. In some policies, the daily benefit      and benefit period may also be multiplied to determine a maximum lifetime      benefit, which is more attractive when benefits received are less than the      daily benefit such as in limited assisted living care. </li>
      <li>A "per diem" policy that      pays out a lifetime maximum benefit, such as $150 daily and a $350,000      lifetime limit. Sometimes these policies will pay a flat amount per day      regardless of the costs incurred.</li>
    </ul>
These amounts are applied to the cost of care for the insured.  On the following pages, we will look at the different types of care that are available.  </div><!-- example-box -->

            <p><strong><em>Medicare</em></strong> is the federal health care program for individuals age 65 or older, or individuals with certain disabilities or illnesses.  It is divided into several parts:</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Part A covers inpatient      hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice care.  </li>
              <li>Part B covers reasonable      and necessary medical services such as doctors' services, outpatient      hospital care, home health care, and medical supplies, among other things. </li>
              <li>Part C is referred to as      "Medicare Advantage Plan" coverage and combines commercial health      insurance coverage with Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. </li>
              <li>Part D covers outpatient prescription      drugs. </li>

            <p><strong><em>Medicaid</em></strong> serves very low-income people of every age. Medicaid patients receive a wide range of medical care, including long-term care, at no or reduced cost. Medicaid is funded by federal, state, and local tax funds. </p>

  Eligibility for Long-Term Care</h3>
<p> There are two approaches to determining when a client is eligible to receive benefits from a long-term care policy:  inability to perform the activities of daily living and cognitive impairment.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each approach to learn more.</span></p>

            <p>Eligibility for long-term care is often regulated by the number of ADLs that are violated.  Benefits are paid if the insured cannot perform a certain number (depends on the policy) of these functions.  Required ADLs usually include:</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Eating </li>
              <li>Dressing</li>
              <li>Bathing</li>
              <li>Transferring (e.g., moving      from bed to chair)</li>
              <li>Toileting</li>
              <li>Continence</li>
              <li>Grooming/personal hygiene</li>

              <li>Mobility inside the home</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Typically,<strong> </strong>a licensed health care practitioner must certify that the need for assistance with the ADLs is reasonably expected to continue for at least 90 days.          </p>
