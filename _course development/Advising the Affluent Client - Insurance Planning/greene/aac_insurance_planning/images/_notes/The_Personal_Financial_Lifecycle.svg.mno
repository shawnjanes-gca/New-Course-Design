In this stage, the concern is for the best alternatives to pass money on to heirs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#xD;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although this typically becomes a primary concern for an older person, even a younger person can also be concerned about properly planning for how their wealth will ultimately transfer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&#xD;&quot; &gt;&#xD;  &lt;/MAP&gt;" />
