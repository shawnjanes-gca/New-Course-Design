<p>Is a professional baseball player earning $3,000,000 per year functionally disabled if he injures his knee sliding into third and can no longer play major league ball? That depends on the definition of disability in his policy. While he may no longer be able to play major league baseball, he can still earn a living as a business executive. This illustrates why the specific definition contained in the policy is a very important issue to understand when dealing with disability insurance.</p>

<div class="p7GPcontent">Policies with this definition provide coverage when the insured is disabled to the point that he or she can no longer work in<strong><em> any occupation</em></strong>. This type of coverage would be meaningless for the professional baseball player. Despite the loss of his professional career, he can still be gainfully employed as a fast food worker or greeter in a retail store.</div>

<div id="p7GPc1_3" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>This definition is more favorable to the disabled worker than the &ldquo;Any Occ&rdquo; definition and less favorable than the &ldquo;Own Occ&rdquo; definition.</p>
<p>If one is unable to perform an occupation for which one is <strong>reasonably suited by training, experience, or education,</strong> then one is disabled under the &ldquo;Reasonable Occ&rdquo; standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A professional baseball player with a career-ending knee injury would not be considered disabled under this standard if he could coach or train other athletes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_4" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>This is the most favorable definition to the insured. As one might expect, it is also the most expensive coverage.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Own occupation&rdquo; coverage replaces income when the insured is no longer able to perform in his or her current occupation.</strong></p>
<p>Surgeons or dentists are examples of persons who might need this type of coverage, as would the professional baseball player.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>For example, should any of these persons be in an accident where they lose a hand, they could no longer perform their current duties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the &ldquo;Any Occ &rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Reasonable Occ&rdquo; definition would cover their disability since they could still earn a living as a greeter or as a coach, but an &ldquo;own occupation&rdquo; policy would.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This coverage is frequently issued for the highest paid occupational classes, and consequently has the highest premiums relative to other types of policies.</p>
