  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Variable Universal Life Insurance</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>This type of insurance provides the features of both Variable and Universal Life insurance.Â  Like Universal Life, the owner can choose the following (within limits): </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The premium amount </li>
    <li>The face amount </li>
    <li>Typically, the type of      death benefit (fixed or variable) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>But like Variable Life, any cash value is placed in a separate investment account(s) and the owner assumes all the investment risk. Also like Variable Life, only those holding both FINRA and state securities licenses, such as licensed broker/dealers, may sell these policies. </p>
  <p> Note that Variable Universal Life insurance policies are subject to the Modified Endowment Contract limits discussed previously. </p>
