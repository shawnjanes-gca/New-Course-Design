  <p>A critical component of assembling an insurance plan is identifying the types of coverage that are appropriate for a given situation.  This can be a daunting task because there are so many needs to identify and so many solutions from which to choose.  Fortunately, there are patterns of need that tend to change as we go through life.  Recognizing this pattern will help provide guidance in identifying insurance needs and identifying appropriate types of coverage.  We refer to these changing patterns as the Personal Financial Life Cycle.</p>
  <p> This cycle of patterns will be discussed on the following pages to identify solution sets that are most commonly applicable to each stage of the financial life cycle.</p>
