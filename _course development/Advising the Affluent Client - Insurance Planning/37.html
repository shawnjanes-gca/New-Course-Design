  <p>The last need to discuss in this course is the need for a periodic review of the insurance plan.  In the investment environment, all investment managers realize the need to review and evaluate the plans they are using to guide the construction and maintenance of their client's portfolios.  Unfortunately, clients are not as fastidious about their insurance purchases or recommendations, and advisors have not taken as proactive a role as they might have.  In an article titled <em>Trust Owned Life Insurance: Is It an Accident Waiting to Happen?, </em>Mark A. Teitelbaum states that even among professional fiduciaries or trustees, little is done to evaluate the ongoing validity of insurance policies.  He states, "Among professional trustees, fully 83.5% indicated they had no guidelines and procedures for handling trust-owned life insurance."  He goes on to state, "For non-professional trustees, 71.2% indicated they had not reviewed their trusts' life insurance policies in the last 5 years."* If trustees do this little, the average client cannot be expected to do any better.</p>
  <h3> Structured Review</h3>
  <p> The policies that make up a client's risk management portfolio should be monitored on a consistent basis.  Basic information about the financial strength of the carrier, where any risk to the benefit lies, and the relative importance of a policy's potential benefit to the overall risk management portfolio -- these are three considerations that can guide how often reviews need to be conducted.  At a minimum, life insurance policy owners should request an in-force illustration every other year.  If a given policy falls below expectations by a pre-determined amount, annual reviews may become appropriate. </p>
  <p> The amount of insurance considered appropriate should be reviewed similarly, especially whenever there has been a significant change in the client's circumstances. Many Advisors would recalculate if the client's marital status changed, their employment changed, there was a birth or adoption in the family, there was a significant change to the financial situation like an inheritance or windfall profit, the client's goals changed appreciably, or if any other significant life event occurred.  The important factor is that, as a trusted advisor, <strong><em>you</em></strong> <strong><em>initiate</em></strong> <strong><em>the conversation </em></strong>around risk management before your client/prospect or your competition does. <strong>  </strong>The following awareness questions can assist you in doing exactly that.</p>
