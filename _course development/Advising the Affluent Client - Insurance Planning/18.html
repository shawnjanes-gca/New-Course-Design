  <h3>Flexible Face Amount </h3>
  <p> Within limits, the policy owner can determine the face amount of the policy upon issue. After a period of time, the owner may request to change the face amount, but a request for an increase typically must be accompanied by evidence of continued insurability. Interestingly enough, the request for a decrease in coverage will also require the insurer's approval to make sure that the cash value is not so great in comparison to the face amount of the policy that it would lose its status as an insurance product and instead become an investment product, thereby losing the tax deferral aspect of the contract. </p>
  <h3> Flexible Benefit </h3>
  <p> At the time of purchase, the owner also decides if the death benefit will be level or will vary with the changes in the cash value. To understand the significance of these choices, refer to the diagrams below.<span class="pageInstruction">Click each number to learn more.</span></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="greene/aac_insurance_planning/images/OptionA_n_OptionB.gif" alt="" width="600" height="282" usemap="#Map"/>
    <map name="Map">
      <area shape="rect" coords="9,155,38,203" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1" title="&lt;strong&gt;1 – Level Benefit Amount&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total benefit amount is fixed and equal to the policy's face amount. At the time of death, the benefit payment will consist of the cash value remaining in the account plus whatever mortality benefit is needed to reach the face amount.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level Benefit Amount = Face Amount&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="194,105,222,146" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;strong&gt;2 – Mortality Cost&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mortality Charge is based upon the net amount at risk to the insurer. The amount at risk is the portion the insurer will need to provide in excess of the cash value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Amount at Risk = Face Amount - Cash Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus the greater the cash value, the less the amount that must be insured and the lower the mortality charge. Therefore, if the owner elects to make large premium payments, the cost for the insurance coverage will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="387,161,417,199" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;strong&gt;3- Variable Benefit Amount&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, insurance coverage is provided for the full face amount, independently of the cash value. Thus the total benefit that is paid out at death is the face amount plus the cash value. In other words, the total benefit is allowed to vary from the face amount in direct relation to the cash value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variable Benefit Amount = Face Amount + Cash Value&lt;/strong&gt;
" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="573,140,600,179" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;strong&gt;4 – Variable Benefit Mortality Cost&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the cash value does not reduce the amount at risk, thus a mortality charge must be assessed against the full face value. Obviously, this will result in higher premiums than the level benefit option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Amount at Risk = Face Amount&lt;/strong&lt;/p&gt;
