                <p>A single premium policy is payable in a single, lump-sum premium. Since it is fully &quot;<strong>paid up</strong>&quot; upon purchase, it has the highest cash value at any point in time of any Whole Life policy.</p>

                  <p>A <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;To prevent Permanent Life insurance policies from being used more for investment purposes than for the insurance protection they provide, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982 created what is known as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TEFRA Corridor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This act imposed limits on the cash value allowed in Permanent Life insurance policies during the first seven years of the policy, requiring that it could not exceed a specified percentage of the policy's face amount. The specific limitation depends upon the insured's age.&lt;/p&gt;                  &lt;p&gt;If the cash value exceeds these limits, then the policy is treated strictly as an investment account and taxed accordingly. As a result, insurers will not allow the cash in the account to exceed these limits. In fact, most policies will state that if cash value does exceed these percentages, then the face amount will automatically increase to stay within the TEFRA corridor. &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1" style="text-transform:none;"><strong>Modified Endowment Contract <em>(MEC)</em></strong></a> is one wherein the premiums paid into the policy during the first seven years exceed certain limits. If a policy is classified as a MEC, the income tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for federal income tax-free treatment, but the owner may be subject to additional income taxes and penalties on any distributions from the policy during the life of the insured.</p>

  	<h3>Learn more about Cash Value (Cash Surrender Value)</h3>
  	<p>Whole life policies also accumulate cash value, which is often referred to as cash surrender value or CSV. This is the amount that would be received, less any surrender costs, if the policy were cashed in. It is also the amount against which loans can be obtained. Everything else being equal, the rate at which the cash value builds is a function of the amount and timing of premiums paid. For example, a single-premium policy or limited-payment policy will have a greater cash value at any point in time than will a continuous premium or modified-premium policy.</p>
  	<p>Do not confuse cash value with the <strong>face amount</strong>, which is the amount of coverage that is payable upon death. This coverage is referred to as &quot;face amount&quot; because it is usually stated on the face of the policy.</p>
  	<p>Cash value will increase over time, typically reaching the face amount at age 99 or 100 or in recent years of issue up to age 120 or 125). Once it reaches the face amount, or "endows," the life insurance policy terminates and is paid out in lump sum or, at the election of the policy owner, as a settlement option.</p>
