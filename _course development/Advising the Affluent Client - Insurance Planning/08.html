              <p>Ideally, people would like to transfer their entire wealth to their chosen heirs, but estate taxes and/or lack of estate liquidity can significantly deplete estate assets. Properly positioned life insurance can provide cash at a critical time to preserve key estate assets.</p>

              <p>Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and closely held businesses can have difficulty planning for succession. There is often the need to pre-plan the successor for the protection of the ongoing viability of the company, but the chosen successor may not have the liquidity to buy out the interest of the departing person.</p>
              <p>When the departure is due to death, there may be the further complication of a large estate tax bill, where the primary estate asset is the deceased's interest in the business. Failure to properly plan for this contingency could result in an unplanned sale of the business, bringing in outside leadership and possibly diminishing the value of the interest held in the company by other interested parties. </p>
