<p>Most people assume the most valuable asset they own is either their home or their investment portfolio.&nbsp; In reality, their life and their ability to generate income is the fuel that propels the ability to gather all those assets.&nbsp; According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the &nbsp;median price of a house in America is $270,900 while the three-year average household median income in the U.S. is $53,046.&nbsp; If a person works a thirty-five year career at the median, career earnings would be nearly one million nine hundred thousand dollars, without adjusting for inflation or salary increases.&nbsp; Clearly, for most people, a healthy life is their most valuable asset.</p>
<p>How do you go about determining the value of a life? Or in the case of disability or long-term care, how do you determine the level of coverage that is needed?</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Most financial planning software provides some ability to value the amount of life insurance a client needs. This method typically uses a present value of the resources needed to maintain certain expenses, independent of whether they are one-time or ongoing.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This calculation takes into account the present value of all income relative to an individual and assumes that figure as the insurance need. For example, wages earned until retirement increasing with inflation, Social Security income, pension income, distributions for qualified retirement plans, etc. are all combined to produce a life insurance amount.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This "rule of thumb" approach to determining life insurance need is somewhat crude, but often times the result is similar to the result produced by sophisticated planning software.</p>
<p>In determining the level of life insurance coverage needed, it is important to not ignore the non-employed spouse, who is typically responsible for child care, home care, meals, errands, etc. The expense of hiring someone to provide those services for the family can be considerable.</p>

<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Most advisors agree that families require about seventy to eighty percent of the income level they had prior to a disability. Also remember to discuss the client's retirement income needs if they have not currently saved sufficient resources to support the goal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p7GPc1_4" class="p7GPcontentwrapper">
<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Clients almost always know of someone who has gone into a nursing home or have a family member who has been impacted by the need for prolonged care. According to the 2012 METLIFE Survey of Long-Term Care Costs, the average cost of a nursing home stay is about $248 a day, or more than $90,520 per year. When that fact is combined with the potential that a spouse may still be at home with the same level of expenses, many clients would be hard pressed to make ends meet without some form of long-term care insurance. The amount needed will largely depend upon the geographic region, as nursing home costs vary significantly across the U.S., whether or not the client wished to be maintained at home, and how much the client can afford to self-insure.</p>
<p>Of the three types of coverage being discussed, this is one that the client is most likely to defer. However, independent of whether or not a client elects to obtain coverage for long-term care, simply taking the time to converse with the client about protecting the family's assets from potential costs of personal care will serve to increase the value the client ascribes to your relationship.</p>
