  <p>Riders are attachments to policies that add additional benefits. While they may add to the cost of the policy, they do provide flexibility in adapting coverage to meet individual needs. This makes it possible to make later adaptations without having to redo the entire policy. They can also place limits on the exposure of the insurer.</p>
  <p>The following are some of the more common benefits that are seen in riders.</p>

                <p>These riders make it possible to receive a portion of the death benefits if you become terminally ill or suffer a serious medical condition. These benefits are exempt from Federal income taxes. Some insurers will also waive future premiums once the benefits begin. Of course, any receipt of benefits while alive will reduce the ultimate death benefit.</p>
                <p>These benefits have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly with the onset of AIDS. They are typically triggered by one of the following events:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>Dread Disease or Catastrophic Illness</strong> - Where the insured has      contracted one of the dread diseases listed in the policy, e.g. cancer. </li>
                  <li><strong>Long-Term or Chronic Care</strong> - Where the insured cannot perform      routine activities of daily living and requires ongoing care in a nursing      home or at home. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act      has defined these activities as: eating, toileting, transferring, bathing,      dressing, and continence. Many insurers have since adopted this list. </li>
                  <li><strong>Terminal Illness</strong> - Where death is expected to occur within the      time period established by the policy, typically less than one year.      According to one study, the vast majority of accelerated death claims are      for this purpose. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For policies that do not provide these services, one possibility for raising cash when faced with a terminal illness is a <strong><em>viatical</em></strong> settlement. In a viatical settlement, the policy on an insured person who only has a year or two to live is purchased as an investment. There has been significant growth of the viatical industry in recent years, increasing the opportunities for such a settlement.              </p>

                <p>These are additional benefits that are paid for accidents. This is triggered in one of two ways: </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>Accidental Death</strong> - Pays an additional amount beyond the face      amount if the insured's death is due to an accident. It is referred to as      a <strong><em>double indemnity</em></strong> benefit if the accidental death benefit      is equal to the face amount. There are some typical exclusions, e.g. war,      suicide, and illegal activities. The coverage usually lapses once the      insured reaches age 65 or 70.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dismemberment</strong> - Provides additional benefit if the insured has an accident in which he or she loses any two limbs, or the sight in both eyes, etc. Typically, riders combine this with accidental death coverage, but will not pay both if the same accident results in death and dismemberment.              </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This rider gives the insured the right to purchase additional insurance of the same type without having to provide evidence of insurability. There are typically specified option dates and limits as to the amount of additional insurance that can be purchased.</p>

                <p>Such benefits either waive the premiums or provide income in case of disability. They generally have a waiting period before benefits begin and typically expire once the insured reaches retirement age. They can usually be seen in one of three types of riders. </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>Waiver of Premium for Disability</strong> - Where the insurer pays the      premiums on behalf of the insured <strong><em>while the insured is disabled</em></strong>.      Note that since the insurer continues paying the premiums, the policy      continues to build cash value. </li>
                  <li><strong>Waiver of Premium for Payor</strong> - Here, the premiums are waived if      the owner dies or becomes disabled. This is typically used when the      insured is a minor, and the waiver usually lapses once the insured reaches      age 18 or 21. </li>
                  <li><strong>Disability Income</strong> - Provides a recurring income benefit to the insured in the event of total disability.              </li>
