    <!-- pagetitle -->

  <p>Insurance purchases are seldom thoughtfully designed and well planned.  In fact, most insurance is purchased for reasons of convenience or out of circumstance.  For example:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  	<ul>
    	<li>"My employer offers optional life insurance of five times my annual salary."</li>
      <li>"I can get long-term disability through work."</li>
      <li>"My insurance person recommended that we have enough to pay the mortgage if something happened."</li>
      <li>"Something came in the mail from my association."</li>
</ul>
  </div><!-- example-box -->
<p>Although the actual purchases may be somewhat random or disjointed from their financial goals, if asked, clients will nonetheless explain their reasoning in terms that apply to their goals and families:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>"That optional insurance      should allow my wife and children to.…"</li>
  <li>"If I get hurt or sick, my      husband and kids wouldn't have to give up the things that are important to      them."</li>
  <li>"If my spouse could pay      the mortgage, then it would not be necessary to change my family's      lifestyle too much."</li>
  <li>"That extra insurance from      the Elks will take care of the debts we have."</li>
</ul>
<p>However, more specifics should be taken into account when creating a high quality risk management plan.  You can differentiate yourself by helping clients work through a <em>process</em> that accounts for the following issues:</p>
<div class="example-box">
	<h3>Issues Regarding the Development of Clear Risk Management Objectives</h3><br>
	<ul>
  	<li>Identification of the types of risk the client deems relevant to his or her financial life</li>
      <li>Quantified risk needs </li>
      <li>Time horizons around those needs</li>
      <li>Risk tolerance or concerns around the certainty of payout</li>
      <li>Guidelines around the types of coverage and providers that are acceptable</li>
      <li>Conditions for changing the portfolio </li>
	</ul>
</div><!-- example-box -->
<p>Recognizing the importance of having a clear plan and the overwhelming number of individuals who lack one, advisors must be well prepared to uncover this potential need and create a sense of urgency to act.  Whenever possible, to avoid embarrassing the client, position the question so that the responsibility for addressing the issue fell on the advisor.</p>
<p> The following are effective questions that will help you accomplish this objective.</p>
<div class="three-key-questions">
  <h3>Awareness Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span>How did your advisor work with you to establish clearly defined risk management objectives?</span></li>
    <li><span>How did your advisor help you define how much coverage you actually need given your specific circumstances?</span></li>
    <li><span>How does your current advisor determine when it's time to make changes to your insurance portfolio?</span></li>
  </ul>
