<p>This course is part of a three-part series on Taxation for Estate Planning. The first two courses examined gift and estate taxes. This course completes the study of transfer taxes by examining Generation Skipping Transfer Taxes. In addition, it addresses certain aspects of income taxation that are relevant to estate planning. The material in this course, along with the other two in the series, should be considered as prerequisite to any study of estate planning techniques.</p>
