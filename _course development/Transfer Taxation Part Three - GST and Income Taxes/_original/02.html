<h2>Generation Skipping Transfer Taxes</h2>
<p>The third aspect of the transfer tax system to be examined is the Generation Skipping Transfer Tax (commonly referred to as the GST tax or as the GSTT). This tax helps ensure that every generation gets taxed. &nbsp;It is IN ADDITION TO any gift or estate taxes that may be applicable to a transfer.&nbsp; Therefore, situations that require payment of both a gift/estate transfer tax AND a GST tax are generally to be avoided, as they may result in a combined tax that is close to the value of the transfer.</p>
<p>GST taxation is an area of taxation that is very complex, and usually involves a specialist when it applies. For most professionals, the primary skills needed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to identify skip persons.</li>
<li>The ability to identify events that trigger the tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course will restrict itself to those two skills. Once an event is identified as potentially triggering the tax, it is advisable that a specialist be involved in the planning.</p>
