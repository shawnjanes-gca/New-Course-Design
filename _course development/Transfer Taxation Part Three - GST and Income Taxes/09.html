  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Income Taxes Relevant to Estate Planning</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Having concluded our study of transfer taxes, we need to give attention to some key features of the income tax system that have bearing on estate planning. Obviously, income taxation can be an exhaustive subject unto itself. For purposes of this course, we will simply note three income tax issues that are of concern to estate planners. The first two are listed below. </p>

              <p>With some limitations, gifts to qualified charities are deductible items for income tax purposes. Given that they are also deductible items for gift and estate taxes as well, gifts to charities are among the most tax-efficient transfers possible.</p>

              <p>Because estate planning may involve transfer of assets to  minors, particularly where there is a desire to transfer income-producing  assets to persons with lower income tax brackets, it is important to know that  there is a &quot;kiddie tax&quot; for children under the age of 19 (under age  24 if a full-time student). Here is how the tax works for 2016:</p>
		<p>For minors under the age of 19 (under age 24 if full-time  student): </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>A child under the age of 19 (under age 24 if full-time student) can receive $1,050 in investment income (interest, dividends or capital gains) free from tax. </li>
                <li>The next $1,1050 is taxed at the child's rate. </li>
                <li>Everything beyond this initial $2,100 is taxed at the parents' rate (assuming the parents' rate is higher than the child's). </li>
                <li>This amount is indexed for inflation and should increase in future years. </li>
              </ul>
			<p>Obviously, this tax makes  it more difficult for a parent to lower their income tax burden on investment  income by gifting assets to minor children. Where the primary goal is to shift  wealth out of the parent's estate, it also makes it advisable to shift low-income  assets so as to maximize the amount that can be shifted over the years. Many  mutual fund companies have funds that are specifically designed to minimize  taxable gains and income.</p>
