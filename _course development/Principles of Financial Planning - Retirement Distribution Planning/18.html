  <p>How about an annual raise of about $22,000 for the rest of  your life? What if you could show your clients how to capture that raise as  well? Read on to find out how.</p>
  <p>The maximum monthly retirement benefit at normal retirement  age is $2,639 (2016, as indexed). That monthly benefit translates into an  annual benefit of almost $32,000. Collecting retirement benefits too early (age  62) slashes the benefit to only about $20,000. Delaying until age 70 catapults the  annual benefit to nearly $42,000. The spread from age 62 to age 70 is about  $22,000 (2016).</p>
  <p>Before going deeper, we need to establish context. A <a href="#" title="Retirement benefits are earned only if a worker is &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;fully insured&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A worker is generally fully insured for retirement benefits if he or she has forty credits. One credit is earned for each $1,260 (2016, as indexed) in compensation from covered employment. A maximum of four credits can be earned per year. Once a worker is fully insured for retirement purposes, he or she remains fully insured for life." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">fully insured</a> worker reaching normal retirement age (age  65-67), receives 100% of their "<a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_2" class="p7TTM_trg" title="The Social Security retirement benefit received at normal retirement age is a worker’s primary insurance amount and will be referred to as “PIA” frequently in this course.

              <p><strong><em>Collecting Social Security benefits at the earliest possible age is  among the worst financial decisions possible unless there is simply no  alternative. </em></strong></p>
			  <p>The earliest a worker can begin receiving retirement  benefits is age 62. At age 62, retirement benefits are permanently reduced by as much as 30% based upon the  worker&rsquo;s birth year and claiming age.* The  claiming age is simply the age at which a worker claims benefits from Social  Security.</p>
			  <p>A worker born in or after 1960 receives only 70% of PIA if  retirement benefits are collected at age 62. Yet, according to the October 2013 <em>AARP Bulletin</em>, 41% of men and 46% of  women voluntarily choose a lifetime of drastically-reduced benefits by claiming  and collecting benefits too early! </p>
              <p>Notably,  the worker's benefit will NOT increase to 100% of PIA when the worker reaches normal  retirement age. The reduction is permanent.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Waiting to collect Social Security benefits until age 70 ranks among  the wisest possible financial decisions for many clients. </em></strong></p>
			  <p>Here is why:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A <strong><em>delayed retirement credit </em></strong>is  available for those choosing to delay collection of Social Security benefits  beyond NRA. </li>
                <li>The delayed retirement credit is applied to  every year of delay from NRA until age 70. </li>
                <li>Workers born in or after 1943 will receive an 8%  increase for each year of delay and could earn as much as a <strong><em>32%</em></strong> <strong><em>permanent  increase</em></strong> to retirement benefits.* </li>
                <li>The increase becomes even more dramatic when we  compare collection of benefits at age 70 to collection of benefits at age 62. The  cumulative annual increase can reach well over 70%. Below is an example.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example – Comparison of Benefit at Age 62 to Benefit at Age 70*</h3><p>Charlene was born in 1950, which means her NRA is age 66. We will assume her PIA is $2,500 at NRA.</p>

              	<li>If she chooses to claim and collect benefits at age 62, her permanently reduced benefit will be $1,875 per month (a 25% reduction from PIA).</li>
                <li>If she chooses to delay collection of benefits until her age 70, her permanently increased benefit will be $3,300 (a 32% increase to PIA).</li>
                <li>The difference between the two benefits is $1,949 ($3,300 - $1,875), which is 76% of $1,875.</li>

<p><em>Yet, the <strong>dilemma</strong> of many can be described by the  following client statement: </em></p>
              <p style="margin:35px;"><em>"I want to stop  working at normal retirement age, but delay collection of benefits until age 70  to gain delayed retirement credits. How do I make ends meet until age 70?&rdquo; </em><strong></strong></p>
