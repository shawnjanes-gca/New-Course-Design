<p>The appropriate divisor is based upon the life expectancy of the owner, the owner and spousal beneficiary, or the owner and non-spousal beneficiary. The account balance used to calculate the RMD is the account balance of the IRA on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the calendar year for which the RMD is due.</p>
<p>Each year's RMD is calculated by dividing the end of the previous year&rsquo;s account balance by the current year's life expectancy factor that is found in the appropriate IRS table. <strong><em>Remember that there is no penalty for taking more than the RMD once your client reaches age 59&frac12;.</em></strong> RMD is best illustrated by <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>example</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>A Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC) may appeal to clients wishing to defer taxes by delaying RMD past the required beginning date (RBD). The QLAC may also resonate with those who fear running out of money if they outlive their life expectancy.</p>
<p>As much as <strong>25%</strong> of a client&rsquo;s balance in certain retirement plans, including Traditional IRAs, may be used to purchase a QLAC. Annuity payments may be deferred beyond the normal RBD, but must begin upon reaching age 85. QLACs are discussed in detail immediately following &ldquo;Managing Distributions From Annuities&rdquo; later in this course.</p>

<div id="p7ABw2_3">
<div id="p7ABc2_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>A solid understanding of life expectancy tables can result in a lower RMD. A lower RMD has at least two potential advantages: 1) a higher IRA balance for the ultimate benefit of the surviving spouse; and 2) more flexibility in income tax planning.</p>
<p>The IRS publishes two life expectancy tables: the Uniform Table and the Joint and Last Survivor Life Expectancy Table.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generally, the <strong><em>Uniform Table</em></strong> is required for calculating RMD. The Uniform Table assumes a beneficiary 10 years younger than the owner. This is true for all IRA owners whether single or married. This is also true even if the beneficiary is actually <strong><em>older</em></strong> than the owner spouse. Unmarried clients must generally use the Uniform Table.<strong> </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Married clients may choose to use either the Uniform Table or the actual <strong><em>Joint and Last Survivor Life Expectancy Table</em></strong> to determine life expectancy in the RMD calculation. This option is available <strong><em>only</em></strong> if the sole beneficiary is the spouse. Whenever the beneficiary spouse is more than ten years younger than the owner spouse, the actual joint and last survivor life expectancy table yields a higher life expectancy than the Uniform Table, thereby lowering the RMD.</p>

<div id="p7ABc2_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs are subject to the RMD rules. RMD for each IRA is calculated separately. However, after the total RMD from all IRAs is calculated, that total amount may be taken from any one or all of your client&rsquo;s IRAs. The following example illustrates the point.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>$500,000 Roth IRA balance, RMD for current year = $0*</p>

<p><strong>Example - Waiting Too Late to Take Distributions</strong></p>
<p>Your client Kayla reached age 70&frac12; during Year 1. She took her RMD of $32,000 <strong><em>for Year 1</em></strong> on April 1, Year 2. Her distribution for Year 1 was timely, in the right amount, and incurred no penalty.</p>
However, she forgot to take an RMD for Year 2 by December 31, Year 2. Assume the RMD <strong><em>for Year</em></strong> <strong><em>2</em></strong> was $30,000. Her penalty is a whopping $15,000 (50% of the amount under distributed for Year 2).</td>

<p>Here is an opportunity to be a hero or heroine to Kayla. In the previous example, Kayla&rsquo;s penalty <strong><em>could be</em></strong> waived by the IRS. IRS has waived the 50% penalty for reasons such as natural disaster, illness, death of a loved one, failure of an IRA custodian or Trustee to notify the IRA owner timely and accurately, and incarceration. Hopefully that last reason will not apply to your clients!</p>
<p><strong><em>Your client should immediately consult with their tax attorney, CPA, or other tax professional as soon as the under distribution is detected. Your role here is to raise awareness only.</em></strong></p>

<h4>10% Premature Withdrawal Penalty</h4>
<p>Taxable distributions from a Traditional IRA taken before age 59&frac12; are generally subject to a penalty of 10% of the taxable amount of the distribution. Exceptions to the 10% penalty follow:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disability (The disability must be one that prevents any gainful employment and is expected to last a long time or result in death)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When distributions are set up as a series of substantially equal periodic payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To pay for unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 10% of adjusted gross income</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To pay health insurance premiums after the owner has received unemployment compensation for more than 12 weeks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To pay the costs of a first-time home purchase<strong> </strong>(subject to a <em>lifetime</em> limit of $10,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To pay for the qualified expenses of higher education for the IRA owner and/or eligible family members</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Julius made nondeductible Traditional IRA contributions of $2,000 each year for 20 years.</p>
<p>His IRA now has a market value of $100,000. Julius is 66 years of age and plans to take a distribution of $10,000 from the IRA this year.</p>
<p>How much of the $10,000 will be taxable? The calculation follows:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Cumulative nondeductible contributions - 20 years @ $2,000/year = $40,000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market value of the IRA = $100,000</p>

<li>
<p>Percent of market value represented by contributions = 40% [$40,000/$100,000]</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Nontaxable return of contributions at 40% = $4,000</p>

<h4>RMD Example</h4>
<p>Ms. Ima Sayver owns a Traditional IRA. She is single, has no named beneficiaries, and turned age 70&frac12; on August 1, Year 1. Therefore, she must compute her RMD for Year 1.</p>
<p>Given the following market values of the IRA and her life expectancy, what is her RMD for Year 1?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Value as of 12/31/Year 0 = $4,000,000</p>
<p>Value as of 12/31/Year 1 = $5,000,000</p>
<p>Life expectancy as of 12/31/Year 0 = 21 years</p>
<p>Life expectancy as of 12/31/Year 1 = 20 years</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution: Divide the previous year-end&rsquo;s account balance by the current year&rsquo;s life expectancy.&nbsp; Ima&rsquo;s RMD is $200,000 calculated as $4,000,000 divided by 20 years.</strong></p>
