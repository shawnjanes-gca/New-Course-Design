<p>Ten thousand people reach age 65 every day in the United States and that trend is expected to continue through the year 2029*. Alarmingly, four of every ten men and about five of every ten women choose to retire early&dagger; and thereby leave tens of thousands of dollars or more on the table.</p>
<p>In the game of poker, one often leaves money on the table when one plays unwisely. In the game of Social Security, we will illustrate how to take the maximum number of dollars possible off of the table. Playing the Social Security game wisely requires the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Claiming benefits at the right age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding spousal benefits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking advantage of creative claiming strategies</p>
</li>
</ul>
