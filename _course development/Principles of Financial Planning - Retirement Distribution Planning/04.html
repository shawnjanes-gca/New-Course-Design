    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Clients seeking income tax-free distributions of earnings are attracted to the Roth IRA. The flexibility to take or avoid taking distributions during the Roth IRA owner’s lifetime may also appeal to clients. We begin our discussion with a review of contributions and will then analyze earnings distributions</p>
  <p><strong><em>The owner of a Roth IRA can always withdraw regular contributions without penalty or  taxation</em></strong>. "Regular Contributions" are nondeductible annual Roth contributions that do not include any rollovers, conversions, or earnings on invested assets in the Roth IRA. In addition, when funds are distributed from a Roth IRA, regular contributions are distributed first.</p>
  <p>On a cumulative basis, once all regular contributions to a Roth IRA are distributed, then earnings are distributed. Distributed earnings may or may not be subject to taxation and penalty. There are three steps to determine the tax implications of a Roth IRA distribution attributable to earnings. <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each step to learn more.</span></p>

                          <p>At least 5 years must have passed since the first contribution to any Roth IRA (measured from the first day of the year for which the first Roth IRA contribution is made). Below is an example.</p>

                          <p>Jill makes her first contribution of $5,000 into a Roth IRA on April 15, Year 2, for the Year 1 tax year. The “five-year rule” starts on January 1, Year 1, because she made the contribution for Year 1 timely by April 15, Year 2.</p> 
<p>Remember that once the 5-year requirement has been satisfied for “regular contributions”, this requirement is deemed to have been satisfied for all subsequent regular contributions.</p>
							<p>The 5-year requirement will be satisfied on December 31, Year 5.  All regular contributions in the account as of that date and all future regular contributions are deemed to have met the 5-year requirement.</p>

   <p>Below is an example of how these rules apply.</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
  	<h3>Example</h3><p>In the summer of Year 1, James opened and funded a Roth IRA with an after-tax contribution of $4,000. He made a second after-tax regular contribution of $4,000 in Year 2. During Year 3, the account balance grew to $8,800. At the end of Year 3, he removed $8,200 for qualified tuition expenses.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>This is NOT a qualified distribution. It meets Condition #2, since it is for tuition expense, but it does not meet Condition #1 since it has been less than 5 years since the initial contribution.</li> 
		<li>Therefore, the amount distributed in earnings (i.e., the amount in excess of his contributions) is taxable. </li>
		<li>In this case, there is a tax due on the $200 in earnings in excess of his total contributions of $8,000. But because it is for one of the permissible penalty-free situations, there is no penalty.</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
<p>How is the taxation of distributions impacted if the Roth IRA contains rollover or conversion contributions?  Click <a href="#" title="&lt;h3&gt;Taxation of Rollover/Conversion Contributions to a Roth IRA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributions to a Roth IRA from rollover or conversion of a Traditional IRA impact the order of distribution. Regular contributions are deemed distributed first, rollover/conversion contributions are deemed distributed next, and earnings are deemed distributed last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a noteworthy caution: the distribution of rollover/conversion contributions is subject to a 10% penalty (but no income tax) if distributed within 5 years of rollover/conversion.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">here</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>
    <div class="example-box" ><h3 style="color:red;">Beware the 50% Penalty for Inherited Roth IRAs</h3><p>Distributions from Roth IRAs are not required during the original owner’s lifetime. However, RMD rules may apply to beneficiaries or new owners of inherited Roth IRAs. Failure to take the RMD timely from an inherited Roth IRA may result in a 50% penalty. Your client should consult with their tax professional to ensure any RMDs are taken timely. </p> </div>
