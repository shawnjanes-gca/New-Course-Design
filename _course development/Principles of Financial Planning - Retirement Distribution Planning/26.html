    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Benefits are reduced for workers choosing to <em><strong>retire before normal retirement age</strong></em> (NRA) if they earn excess income. The reduction is based upon two earnings tests: <a href="#" title="This test applies to the worker choosing to claim and collect benefits before NRA: $1 in benefits will be deducted for each $2 of earnings in excess of the annual limit of $15,720 (2016, as indexed)." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">earnings before NRA</a> and <a href="#" title="The penalty is much less severe in the year of the worker’s NRA. In the calendar year in which the worker or beneficiary attains the NRA, $1 in benefits will be deducted for each $3 of earnings above the annual limit of $41,880 (2016, as indexed). Only earnings before the month in which the worker or beneficiary attains the NRA are counted." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">earnings during the year of NRA</a>. There is no reduction of benefits for income earned in the years after normal retirement age. </p>
  <p>Below are examples of earnings before NRA and earnings during the year of NRA.. </p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
  	<h3>Example - Earnings Before NRA</h3>
    <p>Randy Retiree (age 64) began taking Social Security retirement benefits at age 62. His NRA is age 65. Randy’s retirement benefit, calculated without regard to the earnings test, would have been $18,000 per year. In the current year, Randy earned $10,000 MORE than the annual limit referenced above. Therefore, Randy’s retirement benefit will be reduced by $5,000 - he will receive only $13,000 in the current year.</p>
  
  <h3>Example - Earnings During the Year of NRA</h3>
  <p>Dana Decamp began taking Social Security retirement benefits during the year in which she reached age 65 (her NRA). Dana’s benefit, calculated without regard to the earnings test, would have been $18,000. In the current year, she earned $10,000 MORE than the annual limit referenced above. Therefore, Dana’s retirement benefit will be reduced by $3,333 - she will receive only $14,667 in the current year.</p>
  </div>
  
<p>Noteworthy - any benefits reduced by the earnings test may not be completely lost, they may be recoverable in future years. The recovery calculation can become somewhat complex but for those wishing to know more, see below.</p>
<div class="explanation-widget-box">
 <h3>Example of Recoverable Benefits</h3>
  <p>Your client Brian began collecting retirement benefits on his record at age 62. He was born in 1954 and because he claimed and collected at age 62, he incurred a permanent reduction of his PIA of 25%.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>His NRA is age 66. During the 5-year period from  age 62 through age 66, his retirement benefits were <strong>reduced</strong> as a result of the earnings tests by the <strong>equivalent of 12 months of benefit payments</strong>. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>When Brian reaches his NRA of 66, his monthly  retirement benefit will be recalculated as if he first claimed benefits at age  63 instead of age 62. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Why age 63? He lost the equivalent of 12 months  of benefit payments as a result of the earnings tests. That &quot;lost&quot; 12 months is  added back to his claiming age (62) so that his new claiming age becomes age  63. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>How does this recalculated claiming age help Brian? The recalculated claiming age of 63 means his early retirement decrease to PIA becomes only 20% instead of 25%.</p> 
<p>Therefore, his benefit payment will increase at age 66 by 5% (based on a separate Social Security formula) of his PIA. If he lives long enough, he will recover all of the reduced benefits. </p>

          <p>The earnings test does not apply to unearned income such as investment income, dividends, interest, rents, annuity payments, and distributions from IRAs or qualified plans. </p>
