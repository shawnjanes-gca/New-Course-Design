  <p>Retiring employees with employer provided <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A employer stock option is a written, legally binding commitment (referred to as a grant) to the employee (awardee). The grant specifies the exercise price, vesting period and expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price that must be paid to purchase a share of stock is referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;exercise price&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period of time required before the option can be exercised is referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;vesting period&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;expiration date&lt;/strong&gt; of the option is the last date the option can be exercised.&lt;/p&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">stock options</a> may need your guidance. A complete review of stock options is beyond scope for this course; however, you need to know select aspects of nonstatutory and incentive stock options at a minimum.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Nonstatutory stock options (NSOs)</em></strong>, also referred to as nonqualified stock options, may be encountered more frequently than Incentive Stock Options. NSOs offer no special income tax treatment and are taxed as compensation income when exercised to the extent of the <a href="#" title="The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;bargain element&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the difference bewteen fair market value and purchase price on the exercise date.  Below is an example.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 2em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your client Allison was awarded 1,000 nonstatutory stock options on her employer’s publicly-traded stock. The option allows Allison to purchase stock at $20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the stock is trading at $30 per share, Allison exercised the stock option. She wrote a check to her employer in the amount of $20,000 and received stock with a fair market value of $30,000. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bargain element is $10,000, calculated as 1,000 shares times $10 per share. She is taxed on the $10,000 as if it were compensation income.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">bargain element</a>. Care should be taken to manage the recognition of income in the year exercised to prevent unanticipated income tax rate (bracket) increases.</p>
  <p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incentive Stock Options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are characterized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISOs are limited&lt;/strong&gt; - No more than $100,000 of ISOs can vest per person per year; any amount beyond $100,000 becomes nonqualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The term of the option may not exceed 10 years and the employer’s Board of Directors must authorize the ISO.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The executive must remain an employee from the date of grant to within 90 days of the exercise date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notably, an ISO must be issued at or above fair market value on the date of the grant. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISOs have &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tax benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deferral of gain at exercise date and the conversion of ordinary income into capital gains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; No regular income tax is recognized at the grant date, and no regular income tax is recognized at the exercise date.* Long-term capital treatment applies if the holding period requirements are met.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Holding period requirements provide that the shares may not be disposed of within two years of the date of grant &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; one year after the option is exercised. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the shares are disposed of prematurely, the special tax treatment will be lost and ordinary income will be recognized for the amount of the gain. If the shares are held for the required time period, any recognized gains will be treated as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long-term capital gains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;footertext&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;!-- footertext --&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;* A separate tax – the Alternative Minimum Tax - may apply. Consult your internal resources for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/footer&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">Incentive stock options</a> (ISOs) may not be seen as often as nonstatutory stock options. Although more complex than NSOs, ISOs are highly valued for their long-term capital gains potential.</p>
