  <p>Here is a creative use of the annuity concept for clients seeking lower required minimum distributions (RMDs). We will first establish context for the QLAC and then proceed to its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
  
  <div class="example-box">
    <p>A dramatic change in annuity planning for retirement began July 1, 2014 when the IRS approved QLAC rules. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The purpose of the QLAC is straightforward:  Congress designed these annuities to provide a dependable and fixed retirement  income stream for those individuals not covered by a Defined Benefit plan. </li>
      <li>QLACs can therefore be viewed as Defined Benefit  plan surrogates, at least to some degree, for those seeking the certainty of a  fixed income stream in retirement. </li>
      <li>While both younger and older clients may be  attracted to these annuities, our focus in this discussion is upon those in  retirement. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The QLAC is nothing more complex  than an annuity in <a href="#" title="<p>Only Defined Contribution Category Qualified Plans, Traditional  IRAs, 403(b) Plans, or Governmental 457(b) Plans may own a QLAC. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Defined Contribution Category Plans include  Target Benefit, Money Purchase, Profit Sharing, 401(k), Stock Bonus, and ESOP  Plans.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Roth IRAs and Defined  Benefit plans may NOT own a QLAC.</em></strong>
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">certain retirement plans</a> that allows the account owner to delay RMD for as many as <strong><em>14 years</em></strong> past the normal required beginning date. The lesser of $125,000 or 25% of the account (2016, as  indexed) may be invested in a QLAC. This is a lifetime maximum rather than an  annual limit.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>The allure of the QLAC includes the following advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The QLAC is excluded from the RMD calculation  until as late as age 85! <strong>Below is</strong><strong> an example.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Example</h3><p>Your client Brian, a single individual, owns a $1,000,000 Traditional IRA. Brian is age 70½ and has sufficient income from other sources to fund all of his living expenses.</p>
  <p>Brian can purchase a QLAC with $125,000 of his IRA balance  and thereby defer RMD on that $125,000 until he reaches age 85.    
  <ul>
    <li>The QLAC purchase is excluded from his  Traditional IRA RMD calculation. </li>
    <li>He bases his Traditional IRA RMD calculation on  $875,000 ($1,000,000 - $125,000) rather than $1,000,000.</li>
    <li>Brian will defer a cumulative total of  approximately $150,000* in RMD from his age 70½ through age 85.  </li>
  </ul></p>

    <div class="footertext"></div>

    <p>*Assumes life expectancy from IRS Table 1 and a 6% return on the IRA portfolio.</p>
  </footer>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>The QLAC payout cannot be outlived and is  guaranteed by the insurance company for the life of the annuitant. This may appeal to clients who fear running out  of money if they outlive their life expectancy. </li>
    <li>Your client may name a spouse or (in some cases)  another individual as a beneficiary. However, spousal  benefits and restrictions should be considered.
      <div class="example-box"><h3>Spousal Benefits and Restrictions</h3><br/>
      <ul>
      	<li>The QLAC may be structured as a Joint and Survivor Annuity with another person, generally the spouse. This feature will result in <a href="#" title="Whenever additional  benefits are purchased with an annuity, the additional cost may be charged in  one of two ways: 1) the purchase price of the annuity will increase, or 2) the  amount of the annuity payout will decrease." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">additional cost</a> for the annuity.
      	</li>
      	<li>If the QLAC is purchased with funds from a <a href="#" title="Target Benefit plans and Money Purchase plans may own QLACs as long as the annuity is a joint and survivor annuity with the participant’s spouse as survivor. This requirement does not apply to unmarried individuals." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">Pension Category Qualified Plan</a>, the annuity <em><strong>must</strong></em> generally be structured as a joint and survivor annuity with the spouse. QLACs purchased using funds from plans other than Pension Category plans allow the account owner to name either a spouse or any other person as beneficiary. </li>
      <li>•	At the death of the annuitant, the QLAC may pay a death benefit to the surviving spouse of either a return of <a href="#" title="Assume your client paid $100,000 in premiums to purchase a QLAC.  She collected $2,000 per month for 49 months then died. She has “recovered” $98,000 (49 months x $2,000). She has unrecovered premium of $2,000 calculated as the purchase price of $100,000 less $98,000 in annuity payments received." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">unrecovered premium</a> or a lifetime survivor’s annuity. </li></ul>
      
       </div>
      <!-- example-box -->
    </li>
    <li>The annuity payout is fixed in amount initially, but a cost of living adjustment feature may be incorporated at additional cost.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Noteworthy disadvantages of the QLAC follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Relatively low limits</em></strong> <strong>for the high net worth client</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>The purchase of a QLAC is limited to the lesser of 25% of the account balance or $125,000 (2016, as indexed).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong><em>No liquidity</em></strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>The QLAC may not accumulate a cash value; hence, this product may not be appropriate for a client with a liquidity need.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong><em>Investment restrictions</em></strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Variable annuities are not allowed. Only fixed  annuities are permitted. Hence, maintenance of purchasing power is an issue  unless a cost of living adjustment feature is purchased.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong><em>Interest rate sensitivity</em></strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower interest rates in the market at the QLAC  purchase date will generally translate into lower payouts in retirement. </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong><em>No government guarantee</em></strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>The QLAC is guaranteed by the financial strength  of the insurance company. However, <a href="#" title="&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guaranty Associations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are mandated by the individual states but are not backed by any federal or state government agency. Contact your state Guaranty Association for specific coverage requirements and limits." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Guaranty Associations</a> may provide a measure of protection in the event of insurance company default.</li>
