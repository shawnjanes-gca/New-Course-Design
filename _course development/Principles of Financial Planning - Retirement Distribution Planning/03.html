<p>Clients seeking income tax-free distributions of earnings are attracted to the Roth IRA. The flexibility to take or avoid taking distributions during the Roth IRA owner&rsquo;s lifetime may also appeal to clients. We begin our discussion with a review of contributions and will then analyze earnings distributions.</p>
<p><strong><em>The owner of a Roth IRA can always withdraw regular contributions without penalty or &nbsp;taxation.</em></strong> &ldquo;Regular Contributions&rdquo; are nondeductible annual Roth contributions that do not include any rollovers, conversions, or earnings on invested assets in the Roth IRA. In addition, when funds are distributed from a Roth IRA, regular contributions are distributed first.</p>
<p>On a cumulative basis, once all regular contributions to a Roth IRA are distributed, then earnings are distributed. Distributed earnings may or may not be subject to taxation and penalty. There are three steps to determine the tax implications of a Roth IRA distribution attributable to earnings. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click on each step to learn more.</strong></p>

<p>Taking a distribution up to $10,000 for a first-time home purchase.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>In the summer of 2012, James opened and funded a Roth IRA with an after-tax contribution of $4,000. He made a second regular contribution of $4,000 in 2013. In 2014, the account had grown to $8,800. Later in 2014, he removed $8,200 for qualified tuition expenses.<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is NOT a qualified distribution. It meets Condition #2, since it is for tuition expense, but it does not meet Condition #1 since it has been less than 5 years since the initial contribution. <strong></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the amount distributed in earnings (i.e., the amount in excess of his contributions) is taxable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this case, there is a tax due on the $200 in earnings in excess of his total contributions of $8,000. But because it is for one of the permissible penalty-free situations, there is no penalty.</p>

<h4>Taxation of Rollover/Conversion Contributions to a Roth IRA</h4>
<p>Contributions to a Roth IRA from rollover or conversion of a Traditional IRA impact the order of distribution. Regular contributions are deemed distributed first, rollover/conversion contributions are deemed distributed next, and earnings are deemed distributed last.</p>
Noteworthy - The distribution of rollover/conversion contributions is subject to a 10% penalty (but no income tax) if distributed within 5 years of rollover/conversion.
