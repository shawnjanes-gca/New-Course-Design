<p>Here is a creative use of the annuity concept for clients seeking lower required minimum distributions (RMDs). We will first establish context for the QLAC and then proceed to its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p><strong>The QLAC in Context</strong><br /> A dramatic change in annuity planning for retirement began July 1, 2014 when the IRS approved QLAC rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the QLAC is straightforward: Congress designed these annuities to provide a dependable and fixed retirement income stream for those individuals not covered by a Defined Benefit plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QLACs can therefore be viewed as Defined Benefit plan surrogates, at least to some degree, for those seeking the certainty of a fixed income stream in retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While both younger and older clients may be attracted to these annuities, our focus in this discussion is upon those in retirement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The QLAC is nothing more complex than an annuity in <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>certain retirement plans</strong></a> that allows the account owner to delay RMD for as many as <strong><em>14 years</em></strong> past the normal required beginning date. The lesser of $125,000 or 25% of the account (2016, as indexed) may be invested in a QLAC. This is a lifetime maximum rather than an annual limit.</p>
</blockquote>

</table>
<p>The allure of the QLAC includes the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The QLAC is excluded from the RMD calculation until as late as age 85! <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The QLAC payout cannot be outlived and is guaranteed by the insurance company for the life of the annuitant. This may appeal to clients who fear running out of money if they outlive their life expectancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your client may name a spouse or (in some cases) another individual as a beneficiary.&nbsp; However, <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>spousal benefits and restrictions</strong></a> should be considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annuity payout is fixed in amount initially, but a cost of living adjustment feature may be incorporated at additional cost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Noteworthy disadvantages of the QLAC follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Relatively low limits</em></strong> <strong>for the high net worth client</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purchase of a QLAC is limited to the lesser of 25% of the account balance or $125,000 (2016, as indexed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>No liquidity</em></strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The QLAC may not accumulate a cash value; hence, this product may not be appropriate for a client with a liquidity need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Investment restrictions</em></strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variable annuities are not allowed. Only fixed annuities are permitted. Hence, maintenance of purchasing power is an issue unless a cost of living adjustment feature is purchased.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Interest rate sensitivity</em></strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lower interest rates in the market at the QLAC purchase date will generally translate into lower payouts in retirement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>No government guarantee</em></strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The QLAC is guaranteed by the financial strength of the insurance company. However, <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer6','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>Guaranty Associations</strong></a> may provide a measure of protection in the event of insurance company default.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Your client Brian, a single individual, owns a $1,000,000 Traditional IRA. Brian is age 70&frac12; and has sufficient income from other sources to fund all of his living expenses.</p>
<p>Brian can purchase a QLAC with $125,000 of his IRA balance and thereby defer RMD on that $125,000 until he reaches age 85.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The QLAC purchase is excluded from his Traditional IRA RMD calculation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He bases his Traditional IRA RMD calculation on $875,000 ($1,000,000 - $125,000) rather than $1,000,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brian will defer a cumulative total of approximately $150,000* in RMD from his age 70&frac12; through age 85.&nbsp;</p>
