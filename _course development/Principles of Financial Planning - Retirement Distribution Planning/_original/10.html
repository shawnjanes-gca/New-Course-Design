<h2>Qualified Plan Rollovers and Transfers to IRAs</h2>
</blockquote>
</td>

<tr>

<blockquote>
<p>Thirteen of every fourteen dollars added to IRAs come from rollovers and direct transfers rather than contributions*. The primary difference between a rollover and a direct transfer is access. Your client has access to the funds during a rollover. Clients have no access to the funds in a direct transfer. Other noteworthy differences between rollovers and transfers are illustrated below.</p>
<h3>Rollover from a Qualified Plan to an IRA</h3>
<p>This type of rollover is characterized by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your client receives a distribution from his or her qualified plan, then rolls over or re-deposits the total amount of the distribution into an IRA within 60 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The qualified plan administrator is required to withhold federal taxes of 20% of the rollover amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to redeposit the entire amount within 60 days results in a <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>10% penalty and income tax</strong></a> on the amount NOT re-deposited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no limit to the number of times funds may be rolled <strong><em>from</em></strong> a qualified plan to an IRA; however, only one rollover FROM an IRA is permitted per year per taxpayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual has complete control over the funds for 60 days and can do whatever he or she pleases with the funds during the 60-day period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transfers from a Qualified Plan to an IRA</h4>
<p>The transfer of your client&rsquo;s qualified plan balance directly from one institution to another is called a <strong><em>direct trustee-to-trustee transfer </em></strong>or<strong><em> direct custodian-to-custodian transfer. </em></strong>A transfer is characterized by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As in rollovers, there is no limit on the number of times during the year that an individual can make direct transfers from a qualified plan to an IRA.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The account owner is not permitted to control or access the funds at any time during the transfer.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no 20% withholding by the plan administrator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have distilled select advantages and disadvantages of rollovers/transfers for you in the chart below. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click on each to learn more.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Potentially higher return </strong>through the use of <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>more investment choices</strong></a> and <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>reduced fees</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continued tax-deferred growth</strong> is possible because earnings are not taxed until distributed from the IRA in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your client gains greater control</strong> in that he or she may direct the IRA investments. Many qualified plans do not permit participant control of investment selections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Greater convenience</strong> is achieved by consolidating all investment accounts into IRAs managed by one investment advisor. The benefits of convenience include: a) the simplicity of having all questions addressed to one person rather than among multiple investment providers; b) less opportunity for errors or omissions in the calculation and communication of required minimum distributions; and c) a streamlined recordkeeping/reporting process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid RMDs for Designated Roth Accounts (DRAs)</strong> by rolling over or transferring DRAs to a Roth IRA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="#_s">Continued bankruptcy protection</a></strong> applies to qualified plan funds held in a Conduit or Rollover IRA. This protection applies only so long as the funds are held inside of the Conduit IRA or Rollover IRA. Subsequent distributions to your client may become subject to his or her creditors in bankruptcy.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent"><ol type="1" start="1">
<li>
<p>Rollovers or transfers may result in the loss of capital gains treatment from net unrealized appreciation (see previous discussion).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loans are not permitted from IRAs, while access to loans is generally permitted, but not required, in qualified plans. Contact the plan administrator to determine if loans are allowed from your client&rsquo;s qualified plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premature distribution penalties may apply longer. Distributions from Traditional IRAs before age 59&frac12; may incur a penalty while distributions taken after age 55 from a qualified plan (if the participant has retired from the company) may generally be taken without penalty.</p>

<h4>10% Penalty</h4>
<p>Jane Dough received a $400,000 check from her qualified plan account balance on January 1 as part of a rollover transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The gross amount of the distribution was $500,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan administrator withheld 20% ($100,000) as required for federal tax purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jane re-deposited $400,000 timely (within 60 days) on February 28.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jane will pay a penalty of $10,000 calculated as 10% of $100,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jane will pay income tax on the $100,000 not re-deposited. She receives no income tax deduction for the $10,000 penalty.</p>

<h4>More Investment Choices</h4>
<p>A qualified plan is required to offer only a relatively few number of investment choices. In addition, legal fiduciary restrictions may further limit the type of investment choices available through a qualified plan.</p>
<p>In contrast, IRAs offer a virtually unlimited universe of choices including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p>Hence, a wider variety of client investment risk and return goals may be accomplished with IRAs when compared to typical qualified plan.</p>

<h4>Reduced Fees</h4>
