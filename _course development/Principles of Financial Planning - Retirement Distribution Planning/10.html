  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Qualified Plan Rollovers and Transfers to IRAs</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Thirteen of every fourteen dollars added to IRAs come from rollovers and direct transfers rather than contributions.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">*</sup>  The primary difference between a rollover and a direct transfer is access. Your client has access to the funds during a rollover. Clients have no access to the funds in a direct transfer. Other noteworthy differences between rollovers and transfers are illustrated below.</p>
  <h3>Rollover from a Qualified Plan to an IRA</h3>
  <p>This type of rollover is characterized by the following:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Your client receives a distribution from his or her qualified plan, then rolls over or re-deposits the total amount of the distribution into an IRA within 60 days.</li>
	<li>The qualified plan administrator is required to withhold federal taxes of 20% of the rollover amount.</li> 
	<li>Failure to redeposit the entire amount within 60 days results in a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10% Penalty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jane Dough received a $400,000 check from her qualified plan account balance on January 1 as part of a rollover transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gross amount of the distribution was $500,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plan administrator withheld 20% ($100,000) as required for federal tax purposes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane re-deposited $400,000 timely (within 60 days) on February 28.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane will pay a penalty of $10,000 calculated as 10% of $100,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane will pay income tax on the $100,000 not re-deposited. She receives no income tax deduction for the $10,000 penalty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">10% penalty and income tax</a> on the amount NOT re-deposited. </li>
	<li>There is no limit to the number of times funds may be rolled <em><strong>from</strong></em> a qualified plan to an IRA; however, only one rollover FROM an IRA is permitted per year per taxpayer.</li>
	<li>The individual has complete control over the funds for 60 days and can do whatever he or she pleases with the funds during the 60-day period.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Transfers from a Qualified Plan to an IRA</h3>
  <p>The transfer of your client’s qualified plan balance directly from one institution to another is called a <em><strong>direct trustee-to-trustee transfer</strong></em> or <em><strong>direct custodian-to-custodian transfer</strong></em>. A transfer is characterized by the following:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>As in rollovers, there is no limit on the number of times during the year that an individual can make direct transfers from a qualified plan to an IRA.</li>
    <li>The account owner is not permitted to control or access the funds at any time during the transfer.</li>				    <li>There is no 20% withholding by the plan administrator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We have distilled select advantages and disadvantages of rollovers/transfers for you in the chart below. Click on each to learn more.</p>

<p>In contrast, IRAs offer a virtually unlimited universe of choices including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds. </p>

                    <li><span><strong>Continued tax-deferred growth</strong> is possible because earnings are not taxed until distributed from the IRA in the future.</span></li>

					<li><span><strong>Greater convenience</strong> is achieved by consolidating all investment accounts into IRAs managed by one investment advisor. The benefits of convenience include: a) the simplicity of having all questions addressed to one person rather than among multiple investment providers; b) less opportunity for errors or omissions in the calculation and communication of required minimum distributions; and c) a streamlined recordkeeping/reporting process.</span></li>
