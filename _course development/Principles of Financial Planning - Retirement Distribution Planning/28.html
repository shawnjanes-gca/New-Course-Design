    <p><strong><em>"A well-drafted estate  plan is your assurance that the taxes and costs associated with your death will  be minimized. A good estate plan also keeps the process of settling your estate  as simple and efficient as possible. Most importantly, your estate plan will  ensure that your assets will be used to benefit the people or institutions that  you choose, in the amounts that you choose."</em></strong></p>

              <p>Any decisions a client may want to make about how his or her  assets are distributed after death must be made in advance. The following list  covers some of the issues your clients may be concerned about:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Minor children or grandchildren – Those individuals not able or of legal age to receive assets.</li>
                <li>Spendthrift concerns – The client believes one of the heirs needs to have money doled out as opposed to receiving lump sums.</li>
                <li>Surviving spouses – The spouse has no experience or ability to make decisions about managing an estate.</li>
                <li>Beneficiary designations – remember  that beneficiary designations in an IRA, qualified plan, or life insurance will  generally override provisions in a will!</li>

              <p>Estate taxes may be assessed by the IRS and/or your client's  state taxing authority. While the federal exemption of $5,450,000 (2016,  as indexed) protects most estates from federal taxation, be aware that some  states begin taxing a decedent's estate at only $1,000,000 in estate value.  Click <a href="https://wills.about.com/od/stateestatetaxes/a/stateestatetaxchart.htm" target="_blank">here</a> for more  information.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that nearly  every asset your clients own OR control is included in their taxable estates;  e.g., their home/s, investments, retirement plans, personal property, business  interests, insurance death benefits if individually owned, and some forms of  trusts where they serve as trustee or have power over trust assets. Planning  may be needed to minimize these taxes.</p>

              <p>Estate planning includes making tough decisions about how  you (or your client) wish to be treated if incapacitated, to whom you will  distribute your financial legacy at death, and what method will be used to make  distributions to your heirs. During a client's retirement distribution phase,  these needs should be addressed with an estate planning attorney. Typical  documents required include <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Whether federal estate taxes are an issue to a family or not, intestacy (not having a will) can be a significant problem. While studies have shown that the vast majority of Americans know that having a will is the most important single step they can take in their financial life, 60-75% of all people in this country die without one. The lack of a properly executed will or trust can cause delays in the distribution of the estate, squabbles amongst the family, legal contests to the probate process, and other costly and frustrating issues. &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">wills and/or trusts</a>,  <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Your client may delegate to someone the power to transact financial affairs or manage medical treatment in the event of their own incapacity using a durable power of attorney. &lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" >durable powers of attorney</a> and <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A living will is not a will.

              <p>The  death of an IRA owner serves up an opportunity to gain income tax deferral for  another three generations if the beneficiary is a grandchild. The concept is  simple - generally an inherited IRA may be distributed over the life expectancy  of the beneficiary. This strategy should be considered whenever the  surviving spouse will not need the decedent's  IRA. Implementation of this strategy can be complex and professional tax advice  is required.</p>
