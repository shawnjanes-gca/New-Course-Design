  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Using a Charitable Remainder Trust</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Charitable trusts take some of the risk out of making lifetime gifts for persons who are concerned about loss of income. In fact, they can be particularly advantageous in certain circumstances.</p>
  <h3>Highly Appreciated or Low Income Producing Property</h3>
  <p>The greatest benefit to utilizing a charitable remainder trust is when you are dealing with highly appreciated long-term capital gain property and/or property that provides a very low income. Both of these factors are illustrated in the following scenario.</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
  <h3>Mrs. Thurmond's Situation</h3>
	<p>Mrs. Thurmond was given 100 shares of ABC Company on her 18th birthday. That was 60 years ago! Affected by the Great Depression, this is the only stock she has ever owned. It has split eight times since she received it, now giving her 25,600 shares with a market value of approximately $1,000,000. Her basis is only pennies per share. </p>
<p>Her estate is worth $8 million, some of which is land that she plans to pass on to her children. And her current income is $200,000 per year, of which ABC stock provides $20,000. Her arthritis is requiring her to have some live-in assistance, and she needs to generate an additional $50,000 of income to cover all expenses. She would not be opposed to selling the ABC stock, but does not want to pay the tax bill that will generate. </p>
<p>Her will states her intent to give a substantial portion of her estate to charity, but she has been rather hesitant to give much during her lifetime out of fear of not having enough to meet her needs.</p>

    	<h3>Solution</h3>
		<p>Mrs. Thurmond creates a charitable remainder annuity trust with a 7% payout. She pays no capital gains tax when making the contribution (although she may have to pay some capital gains taxes in future years if the trust passes gains out to her to meet the 7% payout obligation). The trust can then sell the security, diversify the portfolio and distribute $70,000 per year to her.  After taxes, this should provide Mrs. Thurmond with the income she needs. She will also have the added income tax benefit of the charitable deduction. More important, she has met both her income need and fulfilled her charitable intent.</p>
