    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>One of the obstacles to creating a charitable remainder trust is that making the charitable gift requires diminishing the estate that would otherwise pass to the donor's heirs. This can often be overcome by combining the Charitable Remainder Trust with an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (often called a Wealth Replacement Trust). In this way the donor can accomplish all of the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span>Reduce or totally eliminate the estate tax.</span> </li>
    <li><span>Receive an immediate income tax charitable  deduction.</span> </li>
    <li><span>Maintain or even increase income. </span></li>
    <li><span>Support a favorite charity. </span></li>
    <li><span>Preserve the size of the estate that is  passed on to the donor's heirs. </span></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The diagram below illustrates how this works. Part of the diagram is already familiar to you from the earlier presentation of the charitable remainder trust. The only thing new is the introduction of the Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust into the plan. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each numbered bullet to learn more.</span></p>

&lt;p&gt;The donor creates an irrevocable life insurance trust, then contributes to it part of the income he receives from the charitable remainder trust. The irrevocable life insurance trust uses those contributions to purchase life insurance in an amount that will replace assets placed in the charitable trust.  Since the trust is the initial owner of the policy, the insurance proceeds upon the insured’s death will not be subject to estate tax.  (In comparison, if the donor funds the trust with a pre-existing policy on his/her life, then the proceeds escape estate taxation only if the donor lives for at least 3 years after the transfer, as transfers of life insurance within 3 years of death are included in the transferor’s estate.)&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;When the donor dies, the beneficiaries receive the life insurance proceeds, and the charity receives the remainder of the trust assets.&lt;/p&gt;
