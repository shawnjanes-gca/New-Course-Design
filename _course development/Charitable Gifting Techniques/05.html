  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Income Tax Deductibility Limits</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Depending upon the type of charity and the type of property being contributed, there is a limit to how much can be deducted in any given year. This limit is stated as a percent of the adjusted gross income of the donor (excluding any net operating loss carryback). Any amount that cannot be deducted in a given year can be carried forward (used to reduce your tax liability) over the next 5 years. </p>
  <p>These limits are listed below. The maximum cumulative deduction of all types is limited to 50% of adjusted gross income, which is only available for gifts to public charities. When claiming deductions on the income tax return, first priority is given for gifts to public charities. Hence, if a cash gift equivalent to 40% of adjusted gross income was given to a public charity and another cash gift equivalent to 20% of adjusted income was given to a charity that had a 30% limit, the public charity donation would be used first to claim a deduction equal to 40% of adjusted gross income. That would leave only 10% to be used for the other charity, leaving a balance to be carried forward.</p>
  <p>In the exercise below, the limits by property type amounts will appear until you click the reset button at the bottom of the list. Review this list several times, each time mentally trying to identify the amount prior to pointing to the arrow. Here's a hint: the 20% limit only comes into the picture for charities that are not public charities.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each arrow to see the limits by type of property. </span></p>

 <h3>Special Election</h3>
<p>As shown above, it is possible when gifting long-term capital gain assets to use the basis instead of the fair market value. In return for using the lower amount, the limit on the deduction for public charities is raised from 30% to 50%. This election would most likely be made when there was little or no appreciation and the gift was for more than 30% of the gross adjusted income, thereby enabling the donor to deduct a larger portion of the contribution, although at a lesser valuation.</p>
