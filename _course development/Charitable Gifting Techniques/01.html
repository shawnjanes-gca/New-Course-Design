    <p class="objective-leadin">This module will provide you with the knowledge necessary to suggest viable solutions to clients. At the conclusion of this training module, you will:</p>
    <div class="objective-points">
      <p>Be familiar with gift and income taxation of charitable gifts. </p>
      <p>Be conversant with various techniques of making lifetime charitable gifts.</p>
      <p>Recognize the variables that affect the size of the donor's income, the amount of the charitable deduction, and the degree of benefit to the charity. </p>

  <p>The next 50 years will witness an unprecedented transfer of wealth between generations. Estimates of the amount to be transferred go as high as $136 trillion.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup> This presents a great opportunity for many people to take advantage of charitable deductions to save taxes while giving support to charities.</p>
  <p>But a survey of 500 financial advisors, accountants, insurance professionals, and attorneys indicated that the most common obstacle clients face when deciding to make charitable gifts is the fear that there will not be sufficient funds remaining to take care of their own needs.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup> There are solutions that minimize the risk to clients in making lifetime charitable gifts, but that same survey indicated that most financial advisors are limited in their ability to advise clients of these techniques.</p>
  <p>It is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this learning module is not to train you to be a legal or tax expert, but to bring awareness to some of the planning issues and techniques that may be important to the client.  Please remember that your role as an advisor must <strong>not</strong> replace the advice of the client's legal and tax advisors.  As an advisor, you are helping your clients realize the need for proper planning and implement the estate planning strategies by using an array of financial and investment solutions.</p>
