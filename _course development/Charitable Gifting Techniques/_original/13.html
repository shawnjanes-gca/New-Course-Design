<p>Not everyone can make gifts that are sizeable enough to warrant the expense of setting up and managing a trust. That is why many charitable institutions have established their own pooled income funds. Similar to making contributions to a charitable remainder trust, donors who make contributions into a pooled income fund do not pay capital gain on appreciated property, receive recurring income in exchange for their gift, and get an immediate income tax deduction. The amount of that deduction, as with charitable remainder trusts, is the present value of the remainder interest that will go to the charity. Upon their death, the charity receives the principal.</p>
<p>These funds operate much like participation in a mutual fund. Contributions of various donors are pooled together and contributors receive participation units based on the value of their contribution relative to the whole. Income is then received based upon the number of units owned and the investment return of the fund. Although these funds can establish many of their own guidelines, the Internal Revenue Code provides many guidelines that must be observed if a charitable deduction is to be available.</p>
