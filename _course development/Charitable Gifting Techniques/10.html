  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Two Variations on the Charitable Remainder Unitrust</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>One of the great appeals of charitable remainder trusts is the income stream that the income beneficiaries receive. To a large degree, this income stream is protected because principal can be used to make up any deficiencies. But there are times when the donor places greater emphasis on preserving the principal, and wants to prevent encroachments.</p>
  <p>Because the payout of a CRAT is fixed at the beginning, it is not possible to adjust the annual payout so as to prevent encroachments of principal. But with unitrusts it is possible to adjust the payout each year, therefore unitrusts are often drafted in ways that allow the adjustment to prevent encroachment of principal. This is accomplished using one of the following techniques. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each technique to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>A unitrust that pays the lesser of the unitrust amount or the actual net income. If net income is insufficient to reach the unitrust amount, then no encroachment of principal is made to make up the difference.</p>

              <p>Just like the NICRUT, the payout is the lesser of the unitrust amount or net income. However, if net income is insufficient to pay the unitrust amount, the deficiency is carried over to subsequent years and would be covered if there were years with an income surplus.</p>

  <p>These trusts can be more appealing to younger persons who have no immediate need for income. The trustee can adjust the portfolio to maximize growth during the years when income is not needed, and readjust to generate higher income when it is.  However, NICRUTs or NIMCRUTs do have a unique risk in that if the income beneficiary dies during the non-income paying term of the trust, that income is lost to the family forever, since the trust will become payable to the charity.</p>
