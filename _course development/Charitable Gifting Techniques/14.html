<h2>Charitable Lead Trust</h2>

<p>Thus far, the gifting techniques presented have made the donor or some other person the income beneficiary, and the charity the remainder beneficiary. But it is possible to do exactly the reverse through a charitable lead trust. In this case, the charity enjoys the income from the property for a period of time, and distributes the property to the beneficiary(ies) when the trust terminates.</p>
<p>The following features are found in the trust document of a charitable lead trust:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Similar to a charitable remainder trust, a charitable lead trust may be structured to pay income either as a charitable lead annuity trust (CLAT) or charitable lead unitrust (CLUT). However, they are typically structured as annuity trusts to keep the valuation simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust may last for the lifetime of the donor or another individual named by the donor, or for a specific number of years. Unlike a CRT, there is no limit to 20 years if a specific number of years is chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the donor to receive an immediate income tax deduction for making the gift, the charity's interest must be guaranteed by the document and the donor must be taxed on the income generated by the trust. If these conditions are met, the donor receives an immediate income tax deduction for the present value of the future income stream that will go to the charity; then, each year, the donor will be taxed on the trust income with no offsetting charitable deduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike a CRT, no minimum payout is required.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The charitable lead trust is an excellent way to support charities while reducing the gift taxes on the portion that will go to remainder beneficiaries. For example, with an IRS required discount rate of 2.2% (the rate in January, 2015), a $1,000,000 contribution to a 10-year CLAT, paying 7% annually (as valued when the trust was funded) to a charity, will result in a present value calculation of $622,252 as the value of the annuity going to the charity, and the balance of $377,748 as the present value of the gift that will ultimately go to the remainder beneficiaries.</p>
<p>If the trust is instead structured as a 15-year CLAT, then the present value of the gift to the charity increases to $886,135, and the value of the gift to the remainder beneficiaries decreases to $113,865.&nbsp; Structure it as an 18-year CLAT, and the present value of the gift to the remainder beneficiaries declines to zero.</p>
<p>This technique can result in substantial estate and gift tax savings for affluent clients, and are especially powerful when the IRS Discount rate is low. The reason for this is that a low discount rate maximizes the present value of the income stream going to the charity, which in turn lessens the present value of the gift being made to the remainder beneficiaries.</p>

<p>1. A taxable gift may be involved in assigning the remainder interest of the trust assets. The gift tax would be based on the present value of the remainder beneficiaries' right to receive the assets at some future time. Calculation of the tax depends upon the duration of the trust, the payout amount, and the rate used in the IRS tables. But due to the discounting that is derived from giving the charity years of income off the assets, considerable discounting can take place resulting in significant savings over transferring the assets directly to the remainder beneficiaries.</p>

<p>2. Upon the termination of the trust, the remainder beneficiaries receive assets from the trust. Since any transfer taxes were taken into consideration when the trust was funded, this transfer then takes place with no additional gift or estate taxes. This is quite significant, indicating that any appreciation in the market value of the assets within the trust will transfer to the beneficiary(ies) free of gift or estate taxes.</p>
