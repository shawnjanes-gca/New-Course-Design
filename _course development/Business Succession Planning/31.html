<p>In most closely-held  companies, the most likely purchasers of a business interest when an owner, or  an owner's estate, wishes to transfer the ownership are the other partners or  owners in the business. This, of course, assumes that the other owners are  motivated to continue the enterprise. This strategy also typically mitigates  concerns regarding successor leadership and management of the enterprise  because, presumably, the other owners are active in the business. In such  circumstances, business succession planning really becomes more of a business  continuation planning issue, which we discuss in some detail in another course.</p>
<p>A primary tenant of business continuation planning with multiple owners is to establish a Buy-Sell Agreement among the owners. This is a contract that delineates the terms of a future stock/asset transaction between specific groups or individuals.  It may include a trigger event, such as death, disability, divorce or departure and will typically address how the purchase is to be funded.  </p>
  <p>There are two primary types of Buy-Sell Agreements:  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each type to learn more.</span></p>

  <p>Each type of agreement results in different advantages and disadvantages, depending on the varied business structures, objectives, parties of the agreement, and circumstances of each company.  Regardless of the type of agreement drafted for a particular business, Buy-Sell Agreements always offer the following benefits to the business owners:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Peace of mind to the owners, heirs of owners, creditors, vendors and employees of the company</li>
    <li>Guarantees a market for the business interest</li>
    <li>Assists in estate planning for the owners; cash  can be provided at sale and the Agreement may establish the taxable estate value of a decedent's interest that will hold up to IRS scrutiny</li>
    <li>Allows surviving owners a pre-determined allocation of ownership in the business.</li>
  </ul>
