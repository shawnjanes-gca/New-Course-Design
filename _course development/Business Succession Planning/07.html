<p>A <strong><em>Professional Corporation</em></strong> <strong><em>(PC)</em></strong> is a corporation that is limited to professional services, such as those of a doctor, dentist, or lawyer.&nbsp; It presents a unique problem in transferring ownership since a shareholder in a PC must by state law typically be held only by a licensed member of the profession.</p>
<p>If the PC is deemed to have value beyond the skills of the practicing professional, it may be critical to work out a buy-out and succession plan prior to the departure, retirement, disability or death of the PC owner in order for the professional owner or heirs to realize the full value of the ownership in the PC. This is typically easier to accomplish when the professional is in practice with a co-owner(s), since they are the best candidates to enter into a mutually beneficial <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="javascript:void(0);">buy-sell agreement</a></strong></span>.&nbsp; Otherwise, a solo practitioner will want to find an outside professional buyer who wants to absorb or continue the practice of the departing professional.</p>
Tax issues regarding professional corporations can be quite complex. A PC can be organized as a C Corporation or an S Corporation, which we previously discussed. Certain PCs can also be classified as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="javascript:void(0);">Personal Service Corporations</a></strong></span>(PSCs), which are C Corporations, but net earnings of the PSC are taxed at a flat rate of 35% vs. a graduated C Corporation rate.
<p>Alternatively, professionals often operate as a Limited Liability Company, which we cover on the next page.</p>

<h4>Transfers upon Disability or Retirement</h4>
<p>In the event of the owner&rsquo;s departure due to long-term disability or retirement, transfer of the business interest is generally best preplanned with a party who is active in the business or familiar with the business operations and marketplace. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the business is sold, the proceeds may or may not be sufficient to provide for the departing owner&rsquo;s future income needs.&nbsp; Ultimately, if the departing owner cannot forgo the income previously received from business operations, the best course of action is a previously established succession plan that makes use of life and disability insurance, as well as funding a retirement plan.&nbsp; In this manner, the future income needs of the disabled/retired owner can be funded with business dollars.&nbsp; Having such plans in place may also free up the possibility for gifting the business to family members, if desired, since the owner will not be dependent upon sales proceeds to provide funding for retirement income.</p>

<h4>Transfers at Death</h4>
<p>In the event of death, it can be critical that preplanning has been done. &nbsp;If there are any employees, they have no authority to continue business operations following the death of the proprietor. While the executor or administrator will have legal ownership of the business, he or she may have no ability or interest in running the company, or may be uncomfortable with assuming the liability to the estate of the deceased associated with continuing its operation.&nbsp; The alternative is to sell the business post-mortem, but the value tends to drop rapidly without an owner to run it. Relationships with customers and vendors can also be adversely affected.</p>
<p>If a preplanned and funded buy-sell agreement has been worked out with successors, especially if the survivors are active in the business, this transition can work well for all parties. &nbsp;In this case, dependent heirs, such as a spouse, will receive cash in exchange for the business interest and the new owners will receive assets with a higher tax basis, as well as a seamless transition of operations.</p>
