  <p>A <strong><em>Professional  Corporation</em></strong> <strong><em>(PC)</em></strong> is a corporation that is limited to professional services,  such as those of a doctor, dentist, or lawyer.   It presents a unique problem in transferring ownership since a  shareholder in a PC must by state law typically be held only by a licensed  member of the profession.</p>
  <p>If the PC is deemed to have value beyond the skills of the practicing professional, it may be critical to work out a buy-out and succession plan prior to the departure, retirement, disability or death of the PC owner in order for the professional owner or heirs to realize the full value of the ownership in the PC. This is typically easier to accomplish when the professional is in practice with a co-owner(s), since they are the best candidates to enter into a mutually beneficial <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;buy-sell agreement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a formal agreement whereby one party agrees to “buy” and the other party agrees to “sell” an ownership interest in the company at an agreed upon price upon the occurrence of a triggering event (e.g., death, disability, or retirement).&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">buy-sell agreement</a>.  Otherwise, a solo practitioner will want to find an outside professional buyer who wants to absorb or continue the practice of the departing professional.</p>
  <p>Tax issues regarding professional corporations can be quite complex. A PC can be organized as a C Corporation or an S Corporation, which we previously discussed. Certain PCs can also be classified as <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Service Corporations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are defined as corporations that provide services in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting where substantially all of the services are performed by owner-employees.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Personal Service Corporations</a> (PSCs), which are C Corporations, but net earnings of the PSC are taxed at a flat rate of 35% vs. a graduated C Corporation rate.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, professionals often operate as a Limited Liability Company, which we cover on the next page.</p>
