  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Leveraged Buyouts (LBO)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A <strong><em>Leveraged Buyout (LBO</em></strong>) is the purchase  of a company's stock or assets by a small group of investors.  The transfer of the business is financed by  debt that is secured by the assets of the business.  </p>
<p>In  an <strong><em>Employee  Leveraged Buyout</em></strong>, a management group purchases the business, usually  aided by primary and secondary lenders, such as banks.  In very large transactions, the financing is  provided by issuing debt securities to the public through an investment  banker.  </p>
  <p>The responsibility of paying off the debt falls on the company itself.  This means that the new owners must generate enough cash from the business to meet the interest and principal payments on the debt.  Debt is used to supplement the buyer's capital and provides a higher return on equity when things go well. The appropriate amount of leverage depends on several factors, including reliability of cash-flow projections, industry and business trends, and the specific business purchase transaction.</p>
  <p>Often, a leveraged buyout is considered for transferring ownership of a business when the owner has no heirs who are willing or capable of running the business and there is a capable management group in place.  Following are several examples of when an owner may wish to consider an employee LBO as a succession planning technique:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <ul>
      <li>The owner feels commitment toward employees.</li>
      <li>The owner wants to preserve the identity of the  business. </li>
      <li>The business has a strong buyout group.</li>
      <li>The owner and buyers with to accomplish a  seamless and private sale.</li>
      <li>The market for a third party is limited.</li>
      <li>When the cost of debt is less than the cost of  equity, and management is not averse to the resulting level of debt.</li>
    </ul>
