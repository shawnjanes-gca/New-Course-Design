  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Testamentary Transfers</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>While lifetime gifts make it possible to remove future appreciation from one's estates, the fact remains that many, if not most, transfers to family members are made at death.  While the estate executor can sell the business in a manner similar to those available to the business owner while alive, for our purposes we will confine this discussion of testamentary transfers to bequests to family members that are made without consideration (i.e., similar to gifts). </p>
  <p>In making bequests to family members, there are a number of tax breaks that help make such transfers possible without transfer taxation.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each tax break to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>For deaths occurring in 2016, a credit is provided  against estate taxes that exclude the first $5,450,000 (as indexed) of assets  from estate taxes. However, the availability of this exclusion to protect estate  assets at death is reduced to the degree that the lifetime gift tax exclusion has  been used in life. For example, if the lifetime gift tax exclusion were used to  protect a $1,500,000 lifetime gift from gift taxes, then only $3,930,000 of  estate assets at death would have been protected.</p>

            <p>When  a closely held business comprises more than 35% of the adjusted gross estate  (or when businesses comprising more than 20% each are aggregated to over 35%),  it may be possible to pay the estate tax on the business in installments.  In fact, once the estate tax return is filed  9 months after death, the tax due on the business can be deferred for four  years by paying interest only.   Thereafter, the tax is paid in up to 10 annual installments (with  interest).  This can greatly facilitate  transfers of a business to family members, allowing the tax to be paid over  time and avoiding the need to sell the business at a fire sale if cash is  needed to pay the tax.</p>

            <p>Real  property is typically valued for estate tax purposes at its best and highest  use.  Sometimes, however, this derives  valuations that are higher than would be derived by its current actual use.  For example, the real property may be used as  farmland or may be used in a business or trade in an area where higher prices  can be achieved if the land is used for residential development.  For such situations, Section 2032(A) may  allow for a special use valuation that will reduce the estate tax liability associated  with the property.</p>
            <p>To qualify for the special use valuation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The real property must be located in the U.S.</li>
              <li>The decedent must have been a citizen or  resident of the U.S. at the time of death.</li>
              <li>The property must have been used in a farming  operation or business or trade, and actively managed by the decedent or a  family member for at least five of the eight years prior to death.</li>
              <li>The adjusted value of the real or personal  property associated with the farm, business, or trade must be 50% or more of  the adjusted value of the gross estate (with the real property alone  constituting more than 25%).</li>
              <li>The property must pass to a qualified heir  (generally restricted to family members).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If, within ten years of the decedent's death, the qualified heir disposes of any interest in the qualified property to anyone other than another family member or ceases to use the property for a qualified purpose (e.g., as a farm), then the tax savings may be subject to recapture.</p>

            <p>Stock redemptions involving a company owned by family  members can be a tax minefield due to family attribution rules.  Section 303 provides income and estate tax  "assistance" to certain estates holding shares in a closely-held  corporation.  If the value of closely  held stock exceeds 35% of the adjusted gross estate of the deceased  stockholder, a stock redemption can take place between the estate and the  corporation up to the amount of the estate transfer taxes, funeral, and estate  administration expenses.  For this  exception, family attribution rules do NOT apply.  Thus, the estate will typically incur no  income taxes upon sale of the stock to the corporation due to recognition of  the transaction as a sale of stock, the basis of which is stepped up to current  market value at date of death (or six months later, if elected by the  executor).</p>
            <p>In addition, this exception can be utilized if the Section 6166 installment payment of estate taxes is elected.  Thus, stock redemption between the estate and the corporation could take place over a number of years.</p>
