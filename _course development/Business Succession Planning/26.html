<p>While lifetime gifts make it possible to remove future appreciation from one&rsquo;s estates, the fact remains that many, if not most, transfers to family members are made at death.&nbsp; While the estate executor can sell the business in a manner similar to those available to the business owner while alive, for our purposes we will confine this discussion of testamentary transfers to bequests to family members that are made without consideration (i.e., similar to gifts).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In making bequests to family members, there are a number of tax breaks that help make such transfers possible without transfer taxation.&nbsp; <span class="style2"><strong>Click each tax break to learn more.</strong></span></p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Family Business and Section 303 Stock Redemptions</h4>
<p>Stock redemptions involving a company owned by family members can be a tax minefield due to family attribution rules.&nbsp; Section 303 provides income and estate tax &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; to certain estates holding shares in a closely-held corporation.&nbsp; If the value of closely held stock exceeds 35% of the adjusted gross estate of the deceased stockholder, a stock redemption can take place between the estate and the corporation up to the amount of the estate transfer taxes, funeral, and estate administration expenses. &nbsp;For this exception, family attribution rules do NOT apply.&nbsp; Thus, the estate will typically incur no income taxes upon sale of the stock to the corporation due to recognition of the transaction as a sale of stock, the basis of which is stepped up to current market value at date of death (or six months later, if elected by the executor).</p>
<p>In addition, this exception can be utilized if the Section 6166 installment payment of estate taxes is elected.&nbsp; Thus, stock redemption between the estate and the corporation could take place over a number of years.</p>

<h4>Applicable Exclusion Amount</h4>
<p>For deaths occurring in 2015, a credit is provided against estate taxes that exclude the first $5,430,000 (as indexed) of assets from estate taxes. However, the availability of this exclusion to protect estate assets at death is reduced to the degree that the lifetime gift tax exclusion has been used in life. For example, if the lifetime gift tax exclusion were used to protect a $1,500,000 lifetime gift from gift taxes, then only $3,930,000 of estate assets at death would have been protected.</p>

<h4>Section 6166 Election to Pay Estate Tax in Installments</h4>
<p>When a closely held business comprises more than 35% of the adjusted gross estate (or when businesses comprising more than 20% each are aggregated to over 35%), it may be possible to pay the estate tax on the business in installments.&nbsp; In fact, once the estate tax return is filed 9 months after death, the tax due on the business can be deferred for four years by paying interest only.&nbsp; Thereafter, the tax is paid in up to 10 annual installments (with interest).&nbsp; This can greatly facilitate transfers of a business to family members, allowing the tax to be paid over time and avoiding the need to sell the business at a fire sale if cash is needed to pay the tax.</p>

<h4>Section 2032(A) Special Use Valuation</h4>
<p>Real property is typically valued for estate tax purposes at its best and highest use.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, this derives valuations that are higher than would be derived by its current actual use.&nbsp; For example, the real property may be used as farmland or may be used in a business or trade in an area where higher prices can be achieved if the land is used for residential development.&nbsp; For such situations, Section 2032(A) may allow for a special use valuation that will reduce the estate tax liability associated with the property.</p>
<p>To qualify for the special use valuation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real property must be located in the U.S.</li>
<li>The decedent must have been a citizen or resident of the U.S. at the time of death.</li>
<li>The property must have been used in a farming operation or business or trade, and actively managed by the decedent or a family member for at least five of the eight years prior to death.</li>
<li>The adjusted value of the real or personal property associated with the farm, business, or trade must be 50% or more of the adjusted value of the gross estate (with the real property alone constituting more than 25%).</li>
<li>The property must pass to a qualified heir (generally restricted to family members).</li>
</ul>
<p>If, within ten years of the decedent&rsquo;s death, the qualified heir disposes of any interest in the qualified property to anyone other than another family member or ceases to use the property for a qualified purpose (e.g., as a farm), then the tax savings may be subject to recapture.</p>
