  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Providing Equitable Inheritances to Non-Participating Family Members</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A primary reason family business owners delay creation of a business succession plan is the difficulty of determining how to leave their estates to heirs when some of the family members are not actively involved in the business.  Most owners (and successors) will agree that it is unfair for inactive family members to be given equal ownership and equal enjoyment of business profits when they are not actively contributing to its success.  On the other hand, most owners (and inactive family members) would agree that it is unfair to transfer the business solely to the active family members without some type of equalization of their inheritance.</p>
