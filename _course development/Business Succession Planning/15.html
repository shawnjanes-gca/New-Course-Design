  <p>Why would a business owner want to transfer a business interest by sale during his or her lifetime versus waiting to bequeath the interest in a will or trust?</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <p><strong>Reasons for a  Lifetime Sale to Family Members:</strong></p>
    <ol style="width:95%;">
      <li><span>The older generation owner may wish to retire.</span></li>
      <li><span>The sale of a business interest provides funding  for retirement income.</span></li>
      <li><span>Health issues may force the owner to retire.</span></li>
      <li><span>Younger family members may be ready to take over  reins of the business and believe they merit ownership.</span></li>
      <li><span>The older generation owner may wish to reward  the efforts of younger generation family member(s) who are working in the  business.</span></li>
      <li><span>The older generation owner can cause resentment  if contributing less but still making substantial withdrawals from the  business.</span></li>
      <li><span>Lifetime  transfer is one method to alleviate publicity and the cost of probate.</span></li>
      <li><span>Lifetime transfers can reduce transfer taxes at  death of the older generation owner if sales proceeds grow more slowly than  business value, are spent, and/or are gifted.</span></li>
