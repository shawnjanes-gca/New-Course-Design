    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A primary issue for consideration in business succession planning is the selection and grooming of a potential successor(s).  Questions to be answered include:</p>
  <div class="imageRight"> <img src="greene/business_succession_planning/images/Concern_1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt=""/></div>
<ul>
    <li>Who will ultimately be responsible for leading the business?</li>
    <li>Will there be more than one leader?</li>
    <li>How will the owner transfer business or industry-specific knowledge over to       the new leadership?</li>
  </ul>
<p>From a group of potential candidates, the owner(s) must assess the candidates' skills, experience, and leadership abilities against those required by the business. </p>
  <p>The process does not stop with simply identifying the successor.  One of the most critical aspects of the succession process is making sure that the successor is ready to take control of the company when called upon to do so.  Many of the reasons for business failure that were previously listed are a direct result of the successor not being properly trained to manage the business.  Thus, the potential successor should be equipped with knowledge of the company's financials and operations, as well as the policies and procedures that have been established to make the business operate efficiently. </p>
