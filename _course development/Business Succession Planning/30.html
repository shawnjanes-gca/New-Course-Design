              <p>Selling  a business requires a lot of time and expense.   Therefore, a seller should be sure the buyer is committed to running the  business and has the resources to afford the purchase of the business before  expending significant resources to negotiate the sale.</p>
              <p>The purchaser should be able to clearly identify his or her objectives in making the purchase.  Typically, purchasers are motivated by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The chance to operate the business</li>
                <li>The potential for significant financial return </li>
                <li>The opportunity to expand their market</li>
                <li>The opportunity to eliminate competition</li>
                <li>The opportunity to add expertise to the  purchaser's company</li>
              </ul>
				<p>Whatever the motive, the seller should be comfortable that the business will provide the purchaser with the opportunity to achieve the desired goals before investing a significant amount of time and expense arranging a deal.</p>

              <p>In a successful company, the owner(s) have typically  developed and depended on certain key employees for a number of years. The  employer may have promised certain benefits, such as deferred compensation that  is payable to these employees after a company sale takes place. The owner(s)  will want to make sure that the employees are comfortable with the new  ownership and that their promised future benefits are secure.</p>

              <p>In addition to the seller's evaluation of the purchaser's  qualifications, the purchaser should evaluate the business.  The keys to an effective business evaluation  are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Having  reliable information</strong>.  Information  gathering should begin as soon as the purchaser begins to consider buying the  business.  Information should be obtained  from several sources, including the company, vendor, and customers.  This information can be used to verify, compare,  contrast and discover data about the owner, industry, business being acquired,  and competitors.  Of particular interest  is information the seller may be reluctant to disclose (e.g., pending  regulatory requirements, competition, etc.).  </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>A  well-prepared, experienced evaluation team.</strong>   Members of the evaluation team might include CPAs, attorneys, finance  specialists, valuation specialists, environmental specialists, and investment  bankers.  It is important that people  familiar with business valuation techniques are involved and that they use a  disciplined valuation approach.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Business evaluation sounds simple, but in practice the effort is intense and compressed into a relatively short amount of time. </p>

              <p><strong><em>Due diligence</em></strong> refers to the process  of conducting an investigation to determine the full implications of a proposed  transaction.  One goal is to make sure  the buyer and lenders know exactly what they are getting into.  However, it can also benefit the seller by  giving assurance that the buyers possess the skills and financing needed to  successfully run the business and, therefore, repay any seller-financing. It  also helps make sure that the seller understands the tax consequences of the  sale.</p>
              <p>Practically speaking, the primary lender prescribes the nature and extent of the due diligence required.  The purchaser and the seller are generally already familiar with much of the information obtained in a due diligence review.  Nevertheless, due diligence can uncover issues of which neither side is aware. </p>
              <p>It is prudent for all parties involved (buyer, seller, and lenders) to agree in advance on the experts to use for due diligence.  Agreeing on valuation, environmental, and legal experts will avoid the expense of each party hiring its own (although each party will probably want to retain separate legal counsel for negotiation purposes).  </p>

              <p>A  business transfer to a third party can be structured in a number of ways.  Usually, a significant amount of negotiation  is required to agree on the structure (e.g., stock purchase versus an asset  purchase) since it has important tax, legal, and business consequences for all  parties.  Not only must the parties  decide what they want from the deal (e.g., stock or assets, liability  protection, etc.), they must quantify how much they are willing to pay for it  (usually in the form of a price adjustment).</p>

              <p>Purchases  of family businesses are usually financed with a combination of loans and  equity.  The components often come from  different sources.  Depending on its size  and complexity, the financing package can be assembled by a bank, commercial  finance company, business broker, or investment banker. </p>
              <p>Alternatively, the purchase may involve an installment loan financed by the seller. If the purchaser is a large company, the purchase may also be accomplished in the form of debentures or bonds.</p>
