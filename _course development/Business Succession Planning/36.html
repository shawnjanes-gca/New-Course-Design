<p>A Stock Bonus Plan is essentially a qualified profit sharing plan where contributions to the plan are in company stock.  Contributions must adhere to ERISA and Department of Labor rules and regulations regarding non-discrimination, contribution limits, etc.</p>
  <p>If the owner's objective is to transfer ownership to all employees in proportion to their income, this type of plan works well.  Otherwise, ownership transfer is dispersed and may not target specific employees that the departing owner prefers to favor with increased ownership.  Note, too, that contributions to the plan are tax deductible.  The owner receives no proceeds as payment for his or her stock in this type of ownership transfer.  Over time, depending on compensation levels, value of the company, number of plan participants, etc., the majority owner's ownership percentage will be steadily depleted as the vested bonus plan account balances of participants accrue more and more stock.</p>
