  <p>In many ways, business succession planning for an <strong><em>S Corporation</em></strong> is similar to succession planning for closely held C Corporations. Â Unlike a C Corporation, however, with an S Corporation  the company does not pay any taxes. That is to say, all profits "pass through" to the shareholders who are then taxed only at the individual level, rather  than also at the corporate level. </p>
<p>Thus, any transfers of shares will carry with them a proportionate share in company profits.  This may be particularly attractive where an owner is trying to transfer income to family members. However, this technique can also be onerous to the business since shareholders may be receiving profits without contributing to the success of the company.</p>
