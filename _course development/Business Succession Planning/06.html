<p>In many ways, business succession planning for an <strong><em>S Corporation</em></strong> is similar to succession planning for closely held C Corporations. &nbsp;Unlike a C Corporation, however, with an S Corporation the company does not pay any taxes. That is to say, all profits &ldquo;pass through&rdquo; to the shareholders who are then taxed only at the individual level, rather than also at the corporate level.</p>
<p>Thus, any transfers of shares will carry with them a proportionate share in company profits.&nbsp; This may be particularly attractive where an owner is trying to transfer income to family members. However, this technique can also be onerous to the business since shareholders may be receiving profits without contributing to the success of the company.</p>

<h4>Partial Transfers</h4>
<p>Partial transfers, e.g., gifts valued within the annual gift tax exclusion limits, are difficult to accomplish with a sole proprietorship because there are no shares of stock providing for easy transition of incremental ownership rights. If this was deemed beneficial, the proprietor would likely change the business structure to a corporation, an LLC, or possibly a partnership.</p>

<h4>Transfers upon Disability or Retirement</h4>
<p>In the event of the owner&rsquo;s departure due to long-term disability or retirement, transfer of the business interest is generally best preplanned with a party who is active in the business or familiar with the business operations and marketplace. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the business is sold, the proceeds may or may not be sufficient to provide for the departing owner&rsquo;s future income needs.&nbsp; Ultimately, if the departing owner cannot forgo the income previously received from business operations, the best course of action is a previously established succession plan that makes use of life and disability insurance, as well as funding a retirement plan.&nbsp; In this manner, the future income needs of the disabled/retired owner can be funded with business dollars.&nbsp; Having such plans in place may also free up the possibility for gifting the business to family members, if desired, since the owner will not be dependent upon sales proceeds to provide funding for retirement income.</p>

<h4>Transfers at Death</h4>
<p>In the event of death, it can be critical that preplanning has been done. &nbsp;If there are any employees, they have no authority to continue business operations following the death of the proprietor. While the executor or administrator will have legal ownership of the business, he or she may have no ability or interest in running the company, or may be uncomfortable with assuming the liability to the estate of the deceased associated with continuing its operation.&nbsp; The alternative is to sell the business post-mortem, but the value tends to drop rapidly without an owner to run it. Relationships with customers and vendors can also be adversely affected.</p>
<p>If a preplanned and funded buy-sell agreement has been worked out with successors, especially if the survivors are active in the business, this transition can work well for all parties. &nbsp;In this case, dependent heirs, such as a spouse, will receive cash in exchange for the business interest and the new owners will receive assets with a higher tax basis, as well as a seamless transition of operations.</p>
