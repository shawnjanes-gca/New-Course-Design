<p>The need for financial security in retirement may be an overriding concern of an owner who is transferring a business to a successor.  In fact, this need may be a key driver in determining the transfer options an owner is willing to consider. </p>
  <p>In this section of the course, we will list and discuss the potential for previously reviewed transfer techniques to assist in satisfying a need for retirement income. In addition, we will review options related to the business that can also assist the owner in his or her retirement planning.  It is beyond the scope of this course to review any of these techniques or options in detail; rather, our goal is to highlight their impact on retirement planning.</p>
  <p>The selling owner's selection of transfer techniques will be heavily influenced by the amount of assets, particularly income-producing assets that he, she or a spouse may own outside of the business interest. Substantial non-business assets allow the selection of techniques that weigh more heavily toward those that alleviate family and estate planning issues.  In contrast, if a business asset makes up a substantial portion of the selling owner's assets, he or she will likely prefer a succession plan that emphasizes retirement income and/or substantial assets to the seller.</p>
