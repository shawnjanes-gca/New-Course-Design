<p>The need for financial security in retirement may be an overriding concern of an owner who is transferring a business to a successor.&nbsp; In fact, this need may be a key driver in determining the transfer options an owner is willing to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section of the course, we will list and discuss the potential for previously reviewed transfer techniques to assist in satisfying a need for retirement income. In addition, we will review options related to the business that can also assist the owner in his or her retirement planning. &nbsp;It is beyond the scope of this course to review any of these techniques or options in detail; rather, our goal is to highlight their impact on retirement planning.</p>
<p>The selling owner&rsquo;s selection of transfer techniques will be heavily influenced by the amount of assets, particularly income-producing assets that he, she or a spouse may own outside of the business interest. Substantial non-business assets allow the selection of techniques that weigh more heavily toward those that alleviate family and estate planning issues. &nbsp;In contrast, if a business asset makes up a substantial portion of the selling owner&rsquo;s assets, he or she will likely prefer a succession plan that emphasizes retirement income and/or substantial assets to the seller.</p>

The buyer would need to have the resources to pay the premiums or possibly the company might bonus adequate funds to make the premium payments.</p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tax Implications to the Seller</h4>
<p>A significant potential problem with an ESOP purchase of a <em>majority </em>owner&rsquo;s shares is that the IRS may deem the stock sale as a dividend vs. a capital transaction. This would make the proceeds in a sale by a controlling owner immediately taxable as ordinary income to the seller.</p>
<p>If the selling shareholder is not deemed to have received a dividend in the sale of stock to the ESOP, the tax benefits are substantial if certain conditions are met. The primary condition is that no gain is recognized at sale by the seller if he or she reinvests the sale proceeds in qualified replacement securities, i.e., most common or preferred stock, bonds, and/or debt instruments issued by publicly traded or closely held domestic corporations.</p>
