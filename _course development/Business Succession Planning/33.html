  <p>A "Management Buy-Out" is often the best option for a succession plan when an individual or team of ready, willing and able managers is prepared to make a purchase.  This solution, after many years of business development with a management team, can be very rewarding and satisfying for many business entrepreneurs. This option is also an excellent way to keep the business independent and ensure that it will continue operating.</p>
  <p>Naturally, this process involves negotiations regarding price/valuation, terms, and what role the departing owner will play, if any, in the future.  Often, the departing owner will continue in a consulting or even management capacity. This may serve multiple purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The selling owner may receive needed  compensation to assist in retirement planning.</li>
    <li>Compensation payments to the selling owner are  deductible to the company.</li>
   <li>Compensation to the selling owner may serve to  lower the selling price.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In some cases, the buyers will have sufficient cash on hand to complete purchase of the business immediately, but in most cases they will need to finance at least a portion of the purchase.  One solution is for the seller to take a note for the amount of the purchase price not received in a down payment by the buyers.  This type of arrangement has advantages and disadvantages. </p>
