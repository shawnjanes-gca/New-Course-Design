  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Advantages and Disadvantages of an IDGT</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Provided the note's interest rate is not below market, the following benefits are achieved with an IDGT:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>No taxable gift is made in transferring the business interest, since the transfer is a sale rather than a gift.</li>
      <li>No capital gain is recognized upon the sale to the trust; nor is it recognized as the note is paid down. This is because, for income tax purposes, the grantor is still considered the owner of the asset.</li>
      <li>All future appreciation is removed from the grantor's estate.</li>
      <li>When the grantor dies, only the fair market  value of the note is in the grantor's estate.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
  <!-- example-box -->
<p>The main disadvantages are that:</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <ul>
    <li>The fair market value of the loan balance will be included in the grantor's estate (unlike the SCIN, where the unpaid balance  of the loan is excluded from the grantors estate).Â  </li>
    <li>The grantor continues to be taxed on all trust income, although the tax payments themselves may further serve the grantor's objective of reducing the size of the grantor's taxable estate.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<!-- example-box -->
<p>The IDGT will be most successful if the assets are subject to discounts at the time of sale regarding their valuation, such as the discount for lack of control and the discount for lack of marketability.  Another way to be more successful in using an IDGT is if the transferred assets appreciate at a rate higher than the interest rate on the installment note.   </p>
