    <p>Business succession is inevitable.  Ultimately, a business owner must face the  reality that he or she will not be able to lead the business forever.  Thus, the business owner is faced with one of  two possibilities: either a carefully planned and calculated process that is  crafted to meet specific criteria or a rushed and often short-sighted procedure  to address an unplanned departure.  In  this course, we explore the first approach of anticipating the owner's  departure by engaging in <strong><em>Business Succession Planning</em></strong>.</p>
<p>To  avoid confusion, it is important from the outset to distinguish Business  Succession Planning from Business Continuation Planning.  <strong>Business</strong> <strong><em>Succession  Planning is done more from the perspective of the owner.</em></strong>  It prepares the company's employees, its  owner, and the owner's family for the day when the owner no longer participates  in the business—a process that involves determining objectives, making  decisions regarding the future leadership of the business, planning for taxes,  asset protection, and the business owner's estate.</p>
  <p><strong><em>In  contrast, Business Continuation Planning</em></strong> <strong><em>is conducted more from the point of view of  the business.</em></strong>  It seeks to  address the steps a company must take to avoid being crippled by risk-related  events, such as natural disasters, fire, or the loss of an owner or key  employee.</p>
    <p>Considerations and solutions that address Business  Succession Planning and Business Continuation Planning do overlap.  However, there are issues involved with  Business Continuation Planning that are best left as the subject for another  course.  This course, while occasionally  alluding to Business Continuation Planning, will maintain the perspective of  the owner and the owner's desire to identify a successor, prepare that  successor, and identify the manner in which the transfer of ownership shall  take place.</p>
