<p>Business succession is inevitable.&nbsp; Ultimately, a business owner must face the reality that he or she will not be able to lead the business forever.&nbsp; Thus, the business owner is faced with one of two possibilities: either a carefully planned and calculated process that is crafted to meet specific criteria or a rushed and often short-sighted procedure to address an unplanned departure.&nbsp; In this course, we explore the first approach of anticipating the owner&rsquo;s departure by engaging in <strong><em>Business Succession Planning</em></strong>.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, it is important from the outset to distinguish Business Succession Planning from Business Continuation Planning. <strong>Business</strong> <strong><em>Succession Planning is done more from the perspective of the owner.</em></strong>&nbsp; It prepares the company&rsquo;s employees, its owner, and the owner&rsquo;s family for the day when the owner no longer participates in the business&mdash;a process that involves determining objectives, making decisions regarding the future leadership of the business, planning for taxes, asset protection, and the business owner&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>In contrast, Business Continuation Planning</em></strong> <strong><em>is conducted more from the point of view of the business.</em></strong>&nbsp; It seeks to address the steps a company must take to avoid being crippled by risk-related events, such as natural disasters, fire, or the loss of an owner or key employee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considerations and solutions that address Business Succession Planning and Business Continuation Planning do overlap.&nbsp; However, there are issues involved with Business Continuation Planning that are best left as the subject for another course.&nbsp; This course, while occasionally alluding to Business Continuation Planning, will maintain the perspective of the owner and the owner&rsquo;s desire to identify a successor, prepare that successor, and identify the manner in which the transfer of ownership shall take place.</p>
