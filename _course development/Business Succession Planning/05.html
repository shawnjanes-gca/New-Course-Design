  <p>With  a <strong><em>C  Corporation,</em></strong> ownership is broken up into small units of shares of  stock.Â  This makes it much easier to make  partial or incremental transfers of ownership.</p>

  <p>Profits of a C Corporation are taxed separately from its owners under subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.  This results in double taxation of dividends, as no deduction is allowed for the corporation when it makes distribution of dividends.  Thus, the corporation pays tax on the income that is used to pay the dividends, and shareholders are taxed on their receipt of dividends.  In contrast, compensation to employees is deductible by the corporation; thus, compensation is only taxed once.</p>
  <p>This different tax treatment between dividends and compensation can sometimes create conflicts of interest among shareholders of a closely held company.  Shareholders who are actively involved in the corporation may receive income through compensation for their services, which avoids double taxation.  Their preference may be to declare no dividends, thus avoiding double taxation and accumulating capital in the business for expansion/business needs.  Caveat - C Corporation capital accumulations in excess of IRS limits may incur an accumulated earnings tax. Inactive shareholders, however, receive no income unless dividends are declared, and their desire for dividend income may be in conflict with the active shareholders.  Such conflicts can be particularly acute when involving family members.</p>
