  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Concern #2: "What Mode of Transfer Shall I Use?"</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Once a successor is selected, the next issue to address is the mode of transfer to be utilized.  To some degree, the options to be used will differ depending upon the identity of the successor.  On the following pages, we shall examine each of the six transfer options listed on the previous page and explore possible transfer techniques and considerations associated with each.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Keep in mind, as we discuss each option, that the association of  techniques with each option is somewhat subjective.</em></strong>  Many techniques can be used with multiple  options.  For example, while we will  associate gifting techniques with transfers to family members, there is nothing  that restricts gifts of business interests to those outside the family.  However, to avoid duplication and unduly extending  the length of this course, we have attempted to introduce the techniques and  associate them where they are likely, but not exclusively, to be utilized.</p>
