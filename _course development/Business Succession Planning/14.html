  <p>A business owner who wishes to transfer a business interest to  members of his or her family must consider a wide range of issues that are  unique to intra-family transfers.Â  These  issues might ultimately affect the specific transfer techniques that will be  utilized to accomplish the specific objectives of an owner. Issues that are  specific to family transfers include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are there any family members actively working in the business or who might       desire to work in the business in the future?</li>
    <li>What constitutes an equitable inheritance to family members, some of whom may be in the business and some may not?</li>
    <li>What steps are being taken to prepare a family member(s) for management of the business and on what terms would an ownership transfer occur?</li>
  </ul>
<p>These questions illustrate the fact that it is important, when assisting a client, to be able to quickly identify, amidst a wide variety of relevant issues, realistic options that may meet a client's goals in transferring the business to the family, while also taking into consideration the limitations of the client's resources. </p>
  <p>On the following pages, we shall examine transfers to family members, first examining sales techniques, then gifting techniques, and finally addressing testamentary transfers.</p>
