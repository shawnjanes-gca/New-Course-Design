  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Considering All Interests</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>It is important that a business succession plan integrate the interests of all those involved; however, ensuring that a succession plan addresses the needs of the business, its owner, its employees, and the family is often difficult because these interests are often in conflict with one another.  For this reason, succession planning is a delicate process that must balance sometimes very disparate needs.</p>
  <p>To develop a succession plan, the owner(s) should include in the planning process key employees, all business owners, and professional advisors who specialize in business succession.  Key professionals who are often involved include: the attorney, financial planner, trust officer, insurance agent, company banker, and CPA.  These professionals will help develop and control the transition process from beginning to end.</p>
  <p>Beyond the interests of other individuals, it is also important to consider the business structure itself, because there are unique transfer considerations involved for each type of business structure.  On the following pages, we will briefly examine the following business structures, discussing some of the implications of each:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sole Proprietorships</li>
    <li>C Corporations</li>
    <li>S Corporations</li>
    <li>Professional Corporations</li>
    <li>Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies</li>
  </ul>
<p>Discussion of actual techniques for making transfers involving these business entities will occur later in this course.</p>
