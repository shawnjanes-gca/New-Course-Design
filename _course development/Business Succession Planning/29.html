  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Option Two:  Selling to a Third Party</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Often, a closely-held family-owned business will be transferred to family members, but there are numerous reasons why that approach is not always appropriate.  Possibly none of the family members are interested in the business or qualified to manage it. There may also be conflicting relationships among family members and/or between family members and key employees.  When there is not a viable family successor, a fresh start for the company may be more desirable.  To accomplish this, an owner might look to sell the business to another company or to a qualified outside individual. </p>
  <p>Regardless of the reason, selling a business to an outside third party is a common method of transferring ownership in closely held businesses. It can be structured as an asset sale or a stock sale.  The choice between these two methods involves different legal, tax, and accounting consequences to both the seller and the buyer.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each approach to learn more of implications of each type of sale.</span></p>

              <p>Sellers typically prefer stock sales.  In a stock sale, both the assets AND  liabilities of the business are transferred to the new ownership.  In addition, in the event of a lifetime sale,  sellers usually pay relatively low individual capital gains rates when selling  company stock. If the sale occurs after the death of the shareholder, the  estate of the deceased receives a stepped up basis in the stock and pays  little, if any, capital gains tax.</p>

              <p>Buyers typically prefer asset sales.  In an asset sale, the buyer does not assume  liability for actions taken by managers and employees before the transaction is  completed.  The buyer's basis in the  assets will also be the purchase price, which can be depreciated. This is much  more favorable than a stock sale, where the buyer inherits the seller's depreciated  basis.  </p>
              <p>Asset sales are most likely to occur with sole proprietorships and partnerships.  With a sole proprietorship, the seller is actually making an asset sale of the business. If a lifetime sale, the seller would possibly incur ordinary income and capital gains (or losses) from the sale of assets. If sold after the death of the owner, the estate of the deceased receives a stepped up basis in the stock and pays little, if any, capital gains tax.  With partnerships, tax issues in the event of a lifetime or after-death sale are more complex and beyond the scope of this course, but are similar to those of a sole proprietor.</p>
