<p>A  final technique we shall consider for  transfers to family members is an <strong><em>Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)</em></strong>.  Ordinarily, a <strong><em>Grantor Trust </em></strong>is one in  which the grantor (the person creating the trust) is treated as the owner of  the trust for both income tax purposes AND estate tax purposes.  However, an Intentionally Defective Grantor  Trust (IDGT) is an irrevocable trust in which the grantor is treated as the  owner for income tax purposes but NOT as the owner for estate tax  purposes.  In other words, the grantor is  taxed on all trust income, but the assets themselves are outside the grantor's  estate for estate tax purposes.</p>
  <p>This provides a significant planning opportunity for individuals who want to reduce the size of their taxable estates while also transferring their business interest to family members.  In a manner similar to a SCIN, the grantor creates the trust and sells the business interest to the trust in exchange for an installment note.  The note should be for a predetermined period of time and can be self-amortizing or can be interest only with a balloon payment at the end of the term. </p>
