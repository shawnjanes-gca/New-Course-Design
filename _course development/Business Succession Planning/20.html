  <p>Mr. Smith is the owner of a business that has been valued at $3,000,000. In order to transfer the business to family members, Mr. Smith retains legal counsel to draft an FLP agreement. In this agreement, Mr. Smith retains possession of a 2% voting interest in the company while gifting a remaining 98% non-voting interest to family members.  Since the gifted interests are non-voting, their value would likely be discounted due to lack of control and marketability. Suppose the control discount is 25% and the marketability discount is 30%. The resulting gift amounts would be computed as follows:</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft" style="width:50%;margin:auto auto;">
    
    <tr>
      <td>Business Value (100%)</td>
      <td style="text-align:right;"><strong>$3,000,000</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gifted Amount (98%)</td>
      <td style="text-align:right;">2,940,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Control Discount (25%)</td>
        <td style="text-align:right;"><u>(735,000)</u></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td style="text-align:right;">Subtotal:</td>
        <td style="text-align:right;">2,205,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Marketability Discount (30%)</td>
        <td style="text-align:right;"><u>(661,500)</u></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Gifted Amount After Discounts</td>
        <td><u><strong>$1,543,500</strong></u></td>
    </tr>
    
  </table>
  <p>Mr. Smith has reduced the amount of his gift from $3,000,000 to $1,543,500. He has substantially increased the remaining balance of his unified applicable tax exclusion for estate tax purposes. Additionally, his estate now only contains a 2% ownership interest in the business, but he still maintains full control since his interest is the only voting interest in the business.</p>
