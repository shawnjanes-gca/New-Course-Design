  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Meeting the Three Primary Concerns of the Transferring Owner</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Having discussed different types of business structures, we now turn to how a succession plan can be utilized to meet the primary concern of the transferring owner.  In general, the transferring owner is seeking to resolve three primary concerns:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <ol style="width:95%">
      <li><span>Who shall I select and groom as my successor?</span></li>
    
      <li><span>What mode of transfer (e.g., gift, buy-sell  agreement, etc.) shall I use?</span></li>
   
   
      <li><span>Will I have Sufficient Resources for Retirement?</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>On the following pages, we shall address each of these concerns.  To some degree, the concerns are intertwined.  For example, the selection of a successor (e.g., a family member or an outside buyer) will impact the options available as a mode of transfer.  Estate planning issues may also be considered in choosing between possible modes of transfer.  Nonetheless, we shall proceed by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First considering the choices available as a successor.</li>
    <li>Next, for each possible choice of successor, we shall examine available modes of transfer. Certain estate planning considerations will also be discussed as       these transfer modes are considered.</li>
    <li>Finally, we will speak to the need for income following the transfer.</li>
  </ul>
