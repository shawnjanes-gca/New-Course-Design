<h2>Meeting the Three Primary Concerns of the Transferring Owner</h2>
</blockquote>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<blockquote>
<p>Having discussed different types of business structures, we now turn to how a succession plan can be utilized to meet the primary concern of the transferring owner.&nbsp; In general, the transferring owner is seeking to resolve three primary concerns:</p>
<table style="width: 488px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="478"><ol>
<li>
<p>Who shall I select and groom as my successor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What mode of transfer (e.g., gift, buy-sell agreement, etc.) shall I use?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will I have Sufficient Resources for Retirement?</p>
</li>
</ol></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On the following pages, we shall address each of these concerns.&nbsp; To some degree, the concerns are intertwined.&nbsp; For example, the selection of a successor (e.g., a family member or an outside buyer) will impact the options available as a mode of transfer.&nbsp; Estate planning issues may also be considered in choosing between possible modes of transfer.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we shall proceed by:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>First considering the choices available as a successor.</li>
<li>Next, for each possible choice of successor, we shall examine available modes of transfer.&nbsp; Certain estate planning considerations will also be discussed as these transfer modes are considered.</li>
<li>Finally, we will speak to the need for income following the transfer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Compensatory Transfers</h4>
<p>An owner can transfer an unrestricted partnership interest as a form of compensation for services rendered, (i.e., a compensatory transfer).&nbsp; Since it is a form of compensation, it triggers immediate taxable income for the recipient equal to the fair market value of the interest received, reduced by the amount paid, if any.&nbsp; This compensation is deductible to the partnership or LLC.</p>

<h4>Limited Partnership</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>Limited Partnership </em></strong>offers more protection from liability, as limited partners are liable for partnership debts only up to the amount of the partner&rsquo;s capital contributions.&nbsp; A Limited Partnership still has one or more general partners, who are still liable for all partnership liabilities and have full management control of the business.</p>
<p>A Limited Partnership is also a &ldquo;pass-through entity&rdquo; for tax purposes &ndash; the Limited Partnership is not a separate taxable entity.</p>

<h4>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h4>
<p>The characteristics of a <strong><em>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</em></strong> vary based on differences in state laws. The LLC is a legal entity that can be formed by drafting articles of organization and submitting them to an appropriate state agency. An LLC can be treated as a Corporation (any number of members), a Partnership (at least two members), and, in most states, as a Sole Proprietorship (one member) for federal income tax purposes. In all states, however, unlike a General Partnership, no partner is liable for the malpractice of any of the other partners.&nbsp; Thus, an LLC combines the limited liability of a corporation with the benefits of flexibility in tax treatment that is enjoyed by partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Selling or Liquidating an Interest</h4>
<p>Similar to the C Corporation, the interest in the business can be sold or the departing partner/member can liquidate his or her interest back to the company, effectively resulting in a transfer of ownership to the remaining partners/members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the departing partner(s)/member(s) can sell its assets to the successor(s).&nbsp; Often, after an asset sale, the sales proceeds are distributed to the successor owner(s) in complete liquidation of the partnership.</p>
