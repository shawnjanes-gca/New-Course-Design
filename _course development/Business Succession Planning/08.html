              <p>The  characteristics of a <strong><em>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</em></strong> vary  based on differences in state laws. The LLC is a legal entity that can be  formed by drafting articles of organization and submitting them to an  appropriate state agency. An LLC can be treated as a Corporation (any number of  members), a Partnership (at least two members), and, in most states, as a Sole  Proprietorship (one member) for federal income tax purposes. In all states,  however, unlike a General Partnership, no partner is liable for the malpractice  of any of the other partners.  Thus, an  LLC combines the limited liability of a corporation with the benefits of flexibility  in tax treatment that is enjoyed by partnerships. </p>
