    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>As  illustrated in the Family Limited Partnership case study, discounted values can  be quite useful in facilitating intra-family transfers.  Another technique that can be helpful in making  transfers at discounted gift tax valuations is a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust  (GRAT).  A <strong>Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)</strong> is a technique where the  grantor (donor) transfers property (or other assets) into an irrevocable trust  which, in turn, will provide the grantor with a cash annuity payment for a  pre-determined period of time.  Once the  annuity obligation to the grantor has been fulfilled, the beneficiaries of the  trust will receive the balance that is remaining in the trust. </p>
  <p>The  key advantages of using a GRAT are:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li><span>A retained income flow,</span></li>
	<li><span>Transfer of assets to beneficiaries at a reduced valuation, and</span> </li>
	<li><span>Transferring some or all of the appreciation out of the donor's estate.</span></li> 
  </ol>
  <p>Here is how a GRAT works:  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each numbered bullet sequentially to learn more.</span></p>

&lt;p&gt;The grantor gifts property to an irrevocable trust (meaning the grantor cannot change the trust once it is funded).&lt;/p&gt;
">
    <area shape="rect" coords="185,9,238,58" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grantor retains the right to receive an annuity from the trust for a period of years, with the &quot;remainder&quot; of the trust subsequently distributing to non-charitable beneficiaries (e.g., family members).  The amount of the annuity payments is a percentage of the property as valued upon funding, and can be satisfied either through earnings on the assets, distributing assets back to the donor at current market values, or a combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;">

    <area shape="rect" coords="310,12,360,67" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In funding the trust, the grantor makes a gift of the remainder interest that will ultimately pass to the remainder beneficiaries.  Any gift tax due will be due upon funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of the gift (for gift tax purposes) is equal to the amount contributed to the trust minus the value of the annuity that is retained by the grantor.  Thus, the value on which the gift tax is calculated is something less than the amount contributed.  To calculate the value of the annuity, the IRS provides the discount rate to be used (the §7520 rate). &lt;/p&gt;">
    <area shape="rect" coords="106,128,162,182" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the grantor lives beyond the period of the structured annuity, then the trust assets (including appreciation) will pass to the remainder beneficiaries free of additional estate or gift taxes.  However, if the grantor dies before the termination of the structured annuity, then the grantor’s retained interest will cause the trust assets to be included in the grantor’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;" >
    <area shape="rect" coords="362,121,417,170" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume George wants to gift $500,000 of stock to a GRAT from which he wishes to receive an income of $50,000 per year for a duration of 5 years.  At the end of five years, the remaining principal passes to George’s three children. If the IRC Section 7250 rate is 2%, then the present value of George’s retained annuity is $235,673.  Thus, for gift tax purposes, the value of George’s gift to the trust is $500,000 - $235,673 = $264,327.  Let’s further assume that the total return on the stock is 12% per year.  At the end of the 5 years, net of the annual distributions back to George, the remainder beneficiaries will receive $563,528. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a gift of present interest (the remainder beneficiaries do not presently receive anything), thus the annual gift tax exclusion is not available. George will have to rely on his lifetime gift tax exclusion (currently $5.45 million in 2016, as indexed) to avoid paying a gift tax. &lt;/p&gt;" >
