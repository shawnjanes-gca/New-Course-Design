    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p><strong><em>A Family Limited Partnership (FLP)</em></strong> is a limited partnership formed to hold the family business or investments, with the idea that the parents will make gifts of their limited partnership interests to their children.  FLPs have been used by business owners and tax planners for many years as a technique to transfer ownership interests to family members. </p>
  <p>One of the benefits of FLPs is that they simplify gifting of property interests to family members.  Clients often own assets, such as real estate or a business, that can be difficult to divide among children and other potential beneficiaries.  Giving fractional interests in the property may be legally possible, but not practical if the client wants to keep the property ownership intact within the family. Gifting partnership interests to family members is much easier and provides other significant benefits as well. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each additional benefit to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>When  an FLP is structured so that one partner holds all the voting interest and the  other partners hold non-voting interest, valuation discounts can be obtained  for the non-voting interests due to their lack of control and reduced  marketability.  This will be illustrated  in a subsequent case-study.</p>
