  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Lifetime Gifts to Family Members</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>One of the unique characteristics of transfers to family members is the possible desire to make the transfers as gifts rather than sales.  Lifetime gifts of a business interest differ from a sale in two primary ways:</p>
  <ol style="width:95%">
    <li><span>The donor does not receive any cash or  compensation for the gift, thus providing no funds to produce income for the  owner or to fund any personal objectives or needs.  In fact, gifts may actually cause a cash  outflow if a gift tax is incurred, since the donor is responsible for filing a  gift tax return and paying any tax due. </span> </li>
    <li><span>Gifts reduce the size of the donor's estate by  the amount of the gift plus any appreciation that the business interest may  realize after the gift is made.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are two key gift tax exclusions available to facilitate transfers through gifts.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each exclusion to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>Gifts to any person within the <strong><em>annual exclusion</em></strong> ($14,000  in 2016 , as indexed) are excluded from gift taxation.  A husband and wife can "split gifts", thereby  combining their annual exclusions to gift up to twice the annual exclusion  amount ($28,000 in 2016 , as indexed), regardless of which spouse actually  provides the funds.  The only requirement  is that the gift be of a "present interest," meaning the donee must take  receipt of the gift and the benefits of ownership.</p>
              <p>As noted earlier, gifting small increments of a sole proprietorship, partnership or an LLC can be difficult. Gifting of a sole proprietorship interest involves specific assets of varying values, and partnerships require approval of other partners or members. Gifting of corporate stock is much simpler.</p>
              <p>Annually gifting small portions of stock (covered by the  annual gift tax exclusion) can add up to substantial amounts over time.  In addition to reducing the size of the  donor's estate by the value of the stock at the time of transfer, any <strong><em>growth</em></strong> in business value is transferred out of the estate of the donor as well, thus possibly  reducing transfer taxes.  For example, if  a husband and wife joined in making transfers of stock to two children over 10  years, this would result in $560,000 of gifts. In addition, if the stock's  value appreciated at 6% per year, at the end of ten years, the donor would have  removed more than $700,000 of asset value from his or her estate.</p>

              <p>An individual can also make gifts in excess of the annual exclusion that are subject to gift tax. However, there is a cumulative lifetime gift tax credit available to each taxpayer that totals $2,125,800 (in 2016, as indexed), which is equivalent to an exclusion of $5,450,000 of gifted assets (in 2016, as indexed). For example, a married couple could join together in making a tax-free gift of a $10,900,000 business interest (plus additional annual exclusion gifts), assuming neither spouse had made prior taxable gifts.</p>
              <p>Note  again that not only would the size of the donor's estate be reduced by the  value of the gifted business interest, any <strong><em>growth</em></strong> in business value is  transferred out of the estate of the donor as well.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of making gifts during life, rather than waiting to transfer assets at death, is that the tax basis of gifted shares would be the basis of the donor.  In contrast, if the shares are transferred at death, the basis is stepped up to the current fair market value as of death (or 6 months later, if the executor so elects).</p>
<p>Note that when making gifts, the donor will need to establish a credible value of the business interest being transferred. These valuations or appraisals will likely result in extra costs to the donor.  The valuations, however, may allow for discounted values due to the limited marketability of a closely held company and/or due to the gifted shares representing a minority interest.</p>
<p>Also, note that gifts of an interest in a pass-through entity, such as an S Corporation, will result not only in transfer of ownership rights but also in transfer of profits (or losses) to the donee.  This may not be the case with transfers of shares in a C Corporation, since a C Corporation may or may not choose to pay dividends (at the discretion of the majority owners).</p>
