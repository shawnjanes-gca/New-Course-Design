<h2>Options for Transfer of a Business Interest</h2>

<blockquote>The importance and difficulty of selecting and grooming a qualified successor demonstrates why a successor owner of a small business is usually a family member active in the business, an outside party who owns a very similar or complementary business, a business partner, or key employee(s).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the succession plan will generally involve the transfer of leadership and ownership of the business to one or more of these parties.&nbsp; Additionally, if the company is large enough, it may be offered for public sale.&nbsp; If no suitable choice exists among these, then there is always the option of closing the business.
<p>In the end, whatever legal, funding, and managerial options are chosen, only six transfer options exist:</p>

<h4>Compensatory Transfers</h4>
<p>An owner can transfer an unrestricted partnership interest as a form of compensation for services rendered, (i.e., a compensatory transfer).&nbsp; Since it is a form of compensation, it triggers immediate taxable income for the recipient equal to the fair market value of the interest received, reduced by the amount paid, if any.&nbsp; This compensation is deductible to the partnership or LLC.</p>

<h4>Limited Partnership</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>Limited Partnership </em></strong>offers more protection from liability, as limited partners are liable for partnership debts only up to the amount of the partner&rsquo;s capital contributions.&nbsp; A Limited Partnership still has one or more general partners, who are still liable for all partnership liabilities and have full management control of the business.</p>
<p>A Limited Partnership is also a &ldquo;pass-through entity&rdquo; for tax purposes &ndash; the Limited Partnership is not a separate taxable entity.</p>

<h4>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h4>
<p>The characteristics of a <strong><em>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</em></strong> vary based on differences in state laws. The LLC is a legal entity that can be formed by drafting articles of organization and submitting them to an appropriate state agency. An LLC can be treated as a Corporation (any number of members), a Partnership (at least two members), and, in most states, as a Sole Proprietorship (one member) for federal income tax purposes. In all states, however, unlike a General Partnership, no partner is liable for the malpractice of any of the other partners.&nbsp; Thus, an LLC combines the limited liability of a corporation with the benefits of flexibility in tax treatment that is enjoyed by partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Selling or Liquidating an Interest</h4>
<p>Similar to the C Corporation, the interest in the business can be sold or the departing partner/member can liquidate his or her interest back to the company, effectively resulting in a transfer of ownership to the remaining partners/members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the departing partner(s)/member(s) can sell its assets to the successor(s).&nbsp; Often, after an asset sale, the sales proceeds are distributed to the successor owner(s) in complete liquidation of the partnership.</p>
