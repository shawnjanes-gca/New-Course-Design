  <p>The importance and difficulty of selecting and grooming a qualified successor demonstrates why a successor owner of a small business is usually a family member active in the business, an outside party who owns a very similar or complementary business, a business partner, or key employee(s).   Thus, the succession plan will generally involve the transfer of leadership and ownership of the business to one or more of these parties.  Additionally, if the company is large enough, it may be offered for public sale.  If no suitable choice exists among these, then there is always the option of closing the business.</p>
