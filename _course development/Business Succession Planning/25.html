  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Case Study â€“ IDGT </span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>To illustrate the use of an IDGT, let's assume Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $2,000,000 (after the discount for lack of marketability). Instead of selling the business interest directly to the children and taking back an installment note, Mr. Smith creates an intentionally defective grantor trust, naming the children as beneficiaries. He funds the trust with $300,000 of assets other than his business interest and files a gift tax return. Since every individual can make cumulative lifetime gifts of up to $5,250,000 (in 2013, as indexed) without gift taxation, we assume that he has a sufficient unused gift tax credit to avoid paying a gift tax on the $300,000 gift.</p>
  <p>Next, Mr. Smith sells his business interest to the trust for the fair market value of $2 million. In return for the sale of the interest in the IDGT, Mr. Smith takes back a 10-year installment note at 7%. Since this is a sale, there is no gift tax on the transfer of the business interest. Trust income and, if needed, the other trust assets are used to pay off the note.</p>
  <p>During the life of the installment note, the trust averages $300,000 per year of income.  Annual payments to Mr. Smith are $284,755. Mr. Smith is taxed on all trust income, but does not pay tax (neither interest income nor capital gain) on the installment payments themselves because, for income tax purposes, he is still considered the owner of the asset (i.e., it is as if he is paying off a note to himself).  </p>
  <p>With growth of the business, let's assume that the business interest is worth $6,000,000 at the end of ten years.  Mr. Jones has effectively:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Transferred his business interest to his children.</li>
    <li>Removed the $4,000,000 of appreciation on the business interest from his estate.</li>
    <li>Removed from his estate the income taxes paid on the $300,000 of annual trust income.</li>
  </ul>
