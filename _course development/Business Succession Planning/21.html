  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Recapitalization</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p><strong><em>Recapitalization</em></strong> is also often done to facilitate a transfer of  a C Corporation to family members.  This  is especially true when the family business owner wishes to 1) retain an income  stream and/or 2) freeze his/her estate by transferring growth to the family  successors.</p>
<p>A recapitalization involves rearranging the capital structure of the company.  When the owner's objectives include a need for income, typically almost all of the owner's common shares of stock are exchanged for newly issued preferred stock, which pays a dividend, typically at a fixed rate as a percentage of the par value of the preferred stock.  While the preferred stock will provide a relatively predictable and cumulative dividend, it has virtually no growth potential because the growth is retained in the outstanding common shares.</p>
  <p>Typically, the owner transfers common shares to the successor family member(s), while retaining the preferred stocks.  In this manner, the owner receives future income, but all business growth following the transfer is retained with the common stocks and thus accrues to the benefit of the successor owner(s).  <span class="pageInstruction">Click <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Peter Patriarch owns all of the outstanding stock of Patriarch Throne Co., Inc., which totals 1,000 shares of common stock. Patriarch Throne’s Board decides to recapitalize the corporation. It has been determined by professional valuation that the company is worth $10,000,000. The corporation issues 9,000 shares of new preferred stock with a par value of $1,000 per share and a cumulative dividend of $60.00 per year or a 6% yield (assumed current market rate). Peter exchanges 900 shares of his common stock worth $9,000,000 for 9,000 shares of the preferred stock worth $9,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter then gifts (or sells) his $1,000,000 of common stock to his son Paul, who is an officer of the company working in the business. (Employment or relationship of Paul is not necessary to make transaction work – we are assuming here that Peter wants to transfer ownership to his son who is actively involved in the business.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter has accomplished three primary objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter has transferred a business interest to his son at little or no cost to the son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter has a relatively predictable income stream for retirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter has “frozen” the value of his business interest at $9,000,000 vs. allowing the value of the common stock to continue to increase the value of his estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">here</a> for an example of this technique.</span></p>
  <p>Note that recapitalizations can be very complex and must be designed very carefully to avoid unintended consequences.  Your client will want to hire very experienced and competent counsel to consider and arrange such a transaction.</p>
