    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>An owner will usually be sensitive to income-producing retirement assets being provided by a business transfer in proportion to the income-producing assets he or she owns outside of the business interest. The nature of the outside assets and other, more personal issues, may be factors as well.  For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is an inheritance anticipated? </li>
    <li>Over time, will the owner be able to convert  non-income-producing assets to income-producing assets? </li>
    <li>Does the owner have substantial debt,  obligations, or contingent liabilities? </li>
    <li>What  is the status of the owner's health and/or his or her spouse?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As you review these various techniques, consider owners in various financial and personal circumstances.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each Transfer Technique to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>A <em>cash sale</em> certainly is the cleanest and easiest business transfer method to evaluate for  retirement planning purposes. Cash is in hand, taxes must be paid resulting  from the sale, and the seller knows how much net cash is available to invest  and apply to debt or to any other financial needs that arise.</p>
              <p>An <em>installment sale</em> has similar ramifications to a cash sale except the receipt of payments and tax liabilities from the sale are spread out over time. The seller incurs the risk  of a creditor.</p>

              <p>In some cases, the buyer will wish to retain the selling  owner on the payroll, with benefits, or as a consultant for a specified period  of time. If the seller is amenable to this arrangement, the extra income and/or  access to benefits may be a meaningful "bonus."</p>

              <p>If the seller accepts a SCIN or Private Annuity as  payment in a family sale, the risk of death prior to full payment on the note  should be a risk that the seller can afford to take. Motivation for this arrangement  probably is primarily driven by accommodating a family member's ability to  purchase the business.</p>

              <p><em>ESOPs and Stock  Bonus Plans</em> in a small or closely held corporation serve to increase the  number of shares held by the owner. If other employees receive substantive  allocations from these plans, the primary owner's percentage of ownership may  be somewhat diluted. In any case, these shares would likely be included in a  sale of the business.</p>
              <p>A <em>qualified  retirement plan</em>, particularly if substantial contributions have been  allocated to the selling owner for several years, could be a significant source  of retirement income to the seller. These funds are generally secure from  company creditors, segregated from operational funds, and regulated by the IRS  and DOL.</p>
              <p>A <em>nonqualified  deferred compensation plan</em> is a different animal. In this type of plan,  assuming the seller is a plan participant, he or she is a creditor of the  company. That is, the company has promised a specified amount of payments at a  future date but the funding for this type of plan is not regulated and  considered accessible to creditors. In some cases, depending on the plan  design, the deferred compensation may be payable at time of sale. In any event,  these issues should be addressed in the terms of sale. When applicable,  deferred compensation could be a critical retirement planning factor to a  selling owner and he or she will want to make sure receipt of these benefits  are as secure as possible.</p>

              <p>A recapitalization involving an issue of preferred stock  in exchange for common stock is intended to have two primary financial impacts  to the senior family business owner. First, the common shares with growth  potential are removed from the ownership of the senior owner for estate  planning purposes. Second, the preferred stock, owned by the senior owner, will  provide a predictable income stream of priority dividends.</p>
              <p>A recapitalization involving a change to split the  ownership of voting and non-voting shares typically has no impact on cash flow  to shareholders, but can be a useful "freeze" technique for estate planning  purposes.</p>
