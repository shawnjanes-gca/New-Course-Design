  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>An<strong><em> Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</em></strong> is a special type of qualified retirement plan established for the benefit of a  corporation's employees.  S Corporations,  as well as C Corporations, can adopt an ESOP, although there are restrictions  and limitations on the use of ESOPs by S Corporations.  Unlike the typical qualified plan, an ESOP  invests primarily in the employer's stock.   The ESOP may borrow in order to buy the stock and the debt is paid out  of the employer's contributions to the ESOP.  </p>
<p>In business succession planning, ESOPs can be used to create a market for the sale of shares of a closely held corporation or as a vehicle to diversify an owner's stock holdings.  The following example illustrates how this might be done:</p>

<div class="example-box"> An architectural firm, which specializes in civic and major commercial designs, has established an ESOP, but intends to leverage it (i.e., borrow money for it). The company approaches a lender who accepts the company's collateral, as in a traditional loan. The company then lends the cash from the loan to the ESOP. Subsequently, the ESOP exchanges the cash for the allotted stock. The stock is then allocated to the employee participants in the plan. If the primary/majority stockholder opts out of the plan, his or her ownership will be steadily diluted.

  <p>Like all other methods of transfer in a business succession plan, there are advantages and disadvantages to employing an ESOP.  The advantages of using an ESOP are as follows:  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each advantage to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>A  significant potential problem with an ESOP purchase of a <em>majority </em>owner's shares is that the IRS may deem the stock sale as a  dividend vs. a capital transaction. This would make the proceeds in a sale by a  controlling owner immediately taxable as ordinary income to the seller.</p>
              <p>If the selling shareholder is not deemed to have received a dividend in the sale of stock to the ESOP, the tax benefits are substantial if certain conditions are met. The primary condition is that no gain is recognized at sale by the seller if he or she reinvests the sale proceeds in qualified replacement securities, i.e., most common or preferred stock, bonds, and/or debt instruments issued by publicly traded or closely held domestic corporations.</p>

  <p>If considering the use of an ESOP to purchase stock of a company from an owner of the company, highly qualified advisors should assist in determining the tax ramifications of the transaction.  At best, use of an ESOP would most often be used as a partial solution to purchasing a majority stockholder's interest in a company. It could be of more substantial value when departing shareholders each own less than a controlling interest in the company and it is the management team's desire to turn over control of the company to the employees.</p>
