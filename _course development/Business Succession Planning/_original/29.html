<h2>Option Two: Selling to a Third Party</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Often, a closely-held family-owned business will be transferred to family members, but there are numerous reasons why that approach is not always appropriate.&nbsp; Possibly none of the family members are interested in the business or qualified to manage it. There may also be conflicting relationships among family members and/or between family members and key employees. &nbsp;When there is not a viable family successor, a fresh start for the company may be more desirable.&nbsp; To accomplish this, an owner might look to sell the business to another company or to a qualified outside individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, selling a business to an outside third party is a common method of transferring ownership in closely held businesses. It can be structured as an asset sale or a stock sale.&nbsp; The choice between these two methods involves different legal, tax, and accounting consequences to both the seller and the buyer.&nbsp; <span class="style2">Click each approach to learn more of implications of each type of sale.</span></p>

<h4>Asset sale</h4>
<p>Buyers typically prefer asset sales.&nbsp; In an asset sale, the buyer does not assume liability for actions taken by managers and employees before the transaction is completed.&nbsp; The buyer&rsquo;s basis in the assets will also be the purchase price, which can be depreciated. This is much more favorable than a stock sale, where the buyer inherits the seller&rsquo;s depreciated basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asset sales are most likely to occur with sole proprietorships and partnerships.&nbsp; With a sole proprietorship, the seller is actually making an asset sale of the business. If a lifetime sale, the seller would possibly incur ordinary income and capital gains (or losses) from the sale of assets. If sold after the death of the owner, the estate of the deceased receives a stepped up basis in the stock and pays little, if any, capital gains tax.&nbsp; With partnerships, tax issues in the event of a lifetime or after-death sale are more complex and beyond the scope of this course, but are similar to those of a sole proprietor.</p>

<h4>Tax-free exchange of assets or stock</h4>
<p>In some cases, a buyer will offer to exchange stock of the buying corporation for assets and/or stock of the selling corporation. This type of exchange could defer the recognition of taxable gain to the seller until the newly acquired stock is sold, or under current law, the seller would never pay income tax on the gain if he or she held the stock until death. Obviously, the stock received by the seller would need to be perceived as having stable, if not growth, potential and would offer more appeal if it was publicly held and easily marketable.</p>

<h4>Stock sale</h4>
<p>Sellers typically prefer stock sales.&nbsp; In a stock sale, both the assets AND liabilities of the business are transferred to the new ownership.&nbsp; In addition, in the event of a lifetime sale, sellers usually pay relatively low individual capital gains rates when selling company stock. If the sale occurs after the death of the shareholder, the estate of the deceased receives a stepped up basis in the stock and pays little, if any, capital gains tax.</p>
