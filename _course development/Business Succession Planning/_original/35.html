<h2>Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>An<strong><em> Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</em></strong> is a special type of qualified retirement plan established for the benefit of a corporation&rsquo;s employees.&nbsp; S Corporations, as well as C Corporations, can adopt an ESOP, although there are restrictions and limitations on the use of ESOPs by S Corporations.&nbsp; Unlike the typical qualified plan, an ESOP invests primarily in the employer&rsquo;s stock.&nbsp; The ESOP may borrow in order to buy the stock and the debt is paid out of the employer&rsquo;s contributions to the ESOP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In business succession planning, ESOPs can be used to create a market for the sale of shares of a closely held corporation or as a vehicle to diversify an owner&rsquo;s stock holdings.&nbsp; The following example illustrates how this might be done:</p>
<table style="width: 600px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">

<tr>
<td>
<p>An architectural firm, which specializes in civic and major commercial designs, has established an ESOP, but intends to leverage it (i.e., borrow money for it). The company approaches a lender who accepts the company&rsquo;s collateral, as in a traditional loan. The company then lends the cash from the loan to the ESOP. Subsequently, the ESOP exchanges the cash for the allotted stock. The stock is then allocated to the employee participants in the plan. If the primary/majority stockholder opts out of the plan, his or her ownership will be steadily diluted.</p>

<p>Like all other methods of transfer in a business succession plan, there are advantages and disadvantages to employing an ESOP.&nbsp; The advantages of using an ESOP are as follows:&nbsp; <span class="style8">Click each advantage to learn more. </span></p>

<p>If considering the use of an ESOP to purchase stock of a company from an owner of the company, highly qualified advisors should assist in determining the tax ramifications of the transaction. &nbsp;At best, use of an ESOP would most often be used as a partial solution to purchasing a majority stockholder&rsquo;s interest in a company. It could be of more substantial value when departing shareholders each own less than a controlling interest in the company and it is the management team&rsquo;s desire to turn over control of the company to the employees.</p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tax Implications to the Seller</h4>
<p>A significant potential problem with an ESOP purchase of a <em>majority </em>owner&rsquo;s shares is that the IRS may deem the stock sale as a dividend vs. a capital transaction. This would make the proceeds in a sale by a controlling owner immediately taxable as ordinary income to the seller.</p>
<p>If the selling shareholder is not deemed to have received a dividend in the sale of stock to the ESOP, the tax benefits are substantial if certain conditions are met. The primary condition is that no gain is recognized at sale by the seller if he or she reinvests the sale proceeds in qualified replacement securities, i.e., most common or preferred stock, bonds, and/or debt instruments issued by publicly traded or closely held domestic corporations.</p>
