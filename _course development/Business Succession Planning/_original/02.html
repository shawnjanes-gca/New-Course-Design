<h2>The Need for Succession Planning</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>An important step toward succession planning is the development of future leadership as well as systems, policies and procedures that will make a transition of ownership as seamless as possible. While a large Fortune 500 company may have the resources and experienced management team to maintain a diversified infrastructure of experience and expertise, the small company often relies more heavily on the capabilities of its owner(s).&nbsp; Thus, when considering a small company&rsquo;s succession plan, the owner(s) must understand that the life of the business is at stake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following table shows the reasons businesses fail as identified by ROC Systems Pty Ltd., a company that helps accounting firms advise their clients in achieving specific goals.</p>

<p>While &ldquo;lack of a succession plan&rdquo; does not appear on this list, there must be some reason why so many failures occur in the second generation of ownership.&nbsp; Notice, only 18.6 percent of failures&mdash;economic conditions and union problems&mdash;are outside of the owner&rsquo;s control.&nbsp; This fact highlights how important it is for strong leadership to be in place to succeed an outgoing owner, and for the transition to be as smooth for all parties as possible.&nbsp; This is achieved through proper succession planning.</p>
<table style="width: 600px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Consider, for example, a CEO of a closely held company who is notified that he or she is terminally ill.&nbsp; This news has a substantial impact on the CEO, the CEO&rsquo;s family, and the business.&nbsp; Although the CEO may be currently able to work (as opposed to having a disability), the CEO may decide to go ahead and retire, well before the company expected.</p>
<p>Without proper pre-planning, the company may be forced to make a substantial cash payout to buy the retiree&rsquo;s stock. If it cannot do so, then the CEO may be without adequate means to retire.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is the question of the successor&rsquo;s identity, the loss of productivity as management&rsquo;s focus shifts from running a successful business to finding new leadership, and further productivity loss while new leadership develops the ability to keep the business on track.</p>
<p>With a succession plan, there are buy-sell agreements in place that deal with emergency situations like this one.&nbsp; Such agreements not only identify successor owners, but should also address all contingencies of a buy-out, including funding.&nbsp; In addition, there is limited interruption in management of the company because the successor is already identified.&nbsp; Such a plan can save the company critical financial resources, or may save the company altogether.</p>
