<p>A business owner who wishes to transfer a business interest to members of his or her family must consider a wide range of issues that are unique to intra-family transfers.&nbsp; These issues might ultimately affect the specific transfer techniques that will be utilized to accomplish the specific objectives of an owner. Issues that are specific to family transfers include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Are there any family members actively working in the business or who might desire to work in the business in the future?</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>What constitutes an equitable inheritance to family members, some of whom may be in the business and some may not?</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>What steps are being taken to prepare a family member(s) for management of the business and on what terms would an ownership transfer occur?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions illustrate the fact that it is important, when assisting a client, to be able to quickly identify, amidst a wide variety of relevant issues, realistic options that may meet a client&rsquo;s goals in transferring the business to the family, while also taking into consideration the limitations of the client&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>On the following pages, we shall examine transfers to family members, first examining sales techniques, then gifting techniques, and finally addressing testamentary transfers.</p>

<h4>Compensatory Transfers</h4>
<p>An owner can transfer an unrestricted partnership interest as a form of compensation for services rendered, (i.e., a compensatory transfer).&nbsp; Since it is a form of compensation, it triggers immediate taxable income for the recipient equal to the fair market value of the interest received, reduced by the amount paid, if any.&nbsp; This compensation is deductible to the partnership or LLC.</p>

<h4>Limited Partnership</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>Limited Partnership </em></strong>offers more protection from liability, as limited partners are liable for partnership debts only up to the amount of the partner&rsquo;s capital contributions.&nbsp; A Limited Partnership still has one or more general partners, who are still liable for all partnership liabilities and have full management control of the business.</p>
<p>A Limited Partnership is also a &ldquo;pass-through entity&rdquo; for tax purposes &ndash; the Limited Partnership is not a separate taxable entity.</p>

<h4>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h4>
<p>The characteristics of a <strong><em>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</em></strong> vary based on differences in state laws. The LLC is a legal entity that can be formed by drafting articles of organization and submitting them to an appropriate state agency. An LLC can be treated as a Corporation (any number of members), a Partnership (at least two members), and, in most states, as a Sole Proprietorship (one member) for federal income tax purposes. In all states, however, unlike a General Partnership, no partner is liable for the malpractice of any of the other partners.&nbsp; Thus, an LLC combines the limited liability of a corporation with the benefits of flexibility in tax treatment that is enjoyed by partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Selling or Liquidating an Interest</h4>
<p>Similar to the C Corporation, the interest in the business can be sold or the departing partner/member can liquidate his or her interest back to the company, effectively resulting in a transfer of ownership to the remaining partners/members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the departing partner(s)/member(s) can sell its assets to the successor(s).&nbsp; Often, after an asset sale, the sales proceeds are distributed to the successor owner(s) in complete liquidation of the partnership.</p>
