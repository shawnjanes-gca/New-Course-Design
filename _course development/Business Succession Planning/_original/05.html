<p>With a <strong><em>C Corporation,</em></strong> ownership is broken up into small units of shares of stock.&nbsp; This makes it much easier to make partial or incremental transfers of ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Profits of a C Corporation are taxed separately from its owners under subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; This results in double taxation of dividends, as no deduction is allowed for the corporation when it makes distribution of dividends.&nbsp; Thus, the corporation pays tax on the income that is used to pay the dividends, and shareholders are taxed on their receipt of dividends.&nbsp; In contrast, compensation to employees is deductible by the corporation; thus, compensation is only taxed once.</p>
<p>This different tax treatment between dividends and compensation can sometimes create conflicts of interest among shareholders of a closely held company.&nbsp; Shareholders who are actively involved in the corporation may receive income through compensation for their services, which avoids double taxation.&nbsp; Their preference may be to declare no dividends, thus avoiding double taxation and accumulating capital in the business for expansion/business needs.&nbsp; Caveat - C Corporation capital accumulations in excess of IRS limits may incur an accumulated earnings tax. Inactive shareholders, however, receive no income unless dividends are declared, and their desire for dividend income may be in conflict with the active shareholders. &nbsp;Such conflicts can be particularly acute when involving family members.</p>

<h4>Partial Transfers</h4>
<p>Partial transfers, e.g., gifts valued within the annual gift tax exclusion limits, are difficult to accomplish with a sole proprietorship because there are no shares of stock providing for easy transition of incremental ownership rights. If this was deemed beneficial, the proprietor would likely change the business structure to a corporation, an LLC, or possibly a partnership.</p>

<h4>Transfers upon Disability or Retirement</h4>
<p>In the event of the owner&rsquo;s departure due to long-term disability or retirement, transfer of the business interest is generally best preplanned with a party who is active in the business or familiar with the business operations and marketplace. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the business is sold, the proceeds may or may not be sufficient to provide for the departing owner&rsquo;s future income needs.&nbsp; Ultimately, if the departing owner cannot forgo the income previously received from business operations, the best course of action is a previously established succession plan that makes use of life and disability insurance, as well as funding a retirement plan.&nbsp; In this manner, the future income needs of the disabled/retired owner can be funded with business dollars.&nbsp; Having such plans in place may also free up the possibility for gifting the business to family members, if desired, since the owner will not be dependent upon sales proceeds to provide funding for retirement income.</p>

<h4>Transfers at Death</h4>
<p>In the event of death, it can be critical that preplanning has been done. &nbsp;If there are any employees, they have no authority to continue business operations following the death of the proprietor. While the executor or administrator will have legal ownership of the business, he or she may have no ability or interest in running the company, or may be uncomfortable with assuming the liability to the estate of the deceased associated with continuing its operation.&nbsp; The alternative is to sell the business post-mortem, but the value tends to drop rapidly without an owner to run it. Relationships with customers and vendors can also be adversely affected.</p>
<p>If a preplanned and funded buy-sell agreement has been worked out with successors, especially if the survivors are active in the business, this transition can work well for all parties. &nbsp;In this case, dependent heirs, such as a spouse, will receive cash in exchange for the business interest and the new owners will receive assets with a higher tax basis, as well as a seamless transition of operations.</p>

<h4>Lifetime Sale</h4>
