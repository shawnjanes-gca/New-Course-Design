<p>An owner will usually be sensitive to income-producing retirement assets being provided by a business transfer in proportion to the income-producing assets he or she owns outside of the business interest. The nature of the outside assets and other, more personal issues, may be factors as well.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is an inheritance anticipated?</li>
<li>Over time, will the owner be able to convert non-income-producing assets to income-producing assets?</li>
<li>Does the owner have substantial debt, obligations, or contingent liabilities?</li>
<li>What is the status of the owner&rsquo;s health and/or his or her spouse?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you review these various techniques, consider owners in various financial and personal circumstances.&nbsp; <span class="style11">Click on each Transfer Technique to learn more.</span></p>

<h4>Recapitalization</h4>
<p>A recapitalization involving an issue of preferred stock in exchange for common stock is intended to have two primary financial impacts to the senior family business owner. First, the common shares with growth potential are removed from the ownership of the senior owner for estate planning purposes. Second, the preferred stock, owned by the senior owner, will provide a predictable income stream of priority dividends.</p>
<p>A recapitalization involving a change to split the ownership of voting and non-voting shares typically has no impact on cash flow to shareholders, but can be a useful &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; technique for estate planning purposes.</p>

<h4>Disability Buy-Out Insurance</h4>
<p><strong><em>Disability Buy-Out Insurance</em></strong> &ndash; Each buyer purchases Disability Buy-Out Insurance on the seller. In the event of long-term disability of the seller, the buyers would receive insurance proceeds which they could use to purchase the seller&rsquo;s stock. The buyer would need to have the resources to pay the premiums or possibly the company might bonus adequate funds to make the premium payments.</p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Business Retirement Plans</h4>
<p><em>ESOPs and Stock Bonus Plans</em> in a small or closely held corporation serve to increase the number of shares held by the owner. If other employees receive substantive allocations from these plans, the primary owner&rsquo;s percentage of ownership may be somewhat diluted. In any case, these shares would likely be included in a sale of the business.</p>
<p>A <em>qualified retirement plan</em>, particularly if substantial contributions have been allocated to the selling owner for several years, could be a significant source of retirement income to the seller. These funds are generally secure from company creditors, segregated from operational funds, and regulated by the IRS and DOL.</p>
<p>A <em>nonqualified deferred compensation plan</em> is a different animal. In this type of plan, assuming the seller is a plan participant, he or she is a creditor of the company. That is, the company has promised a specified amount of payments at a future date but the funding for this type of plan is not regulated and considered accessible to creditors. In some cases, depending on the plan design, the deferred compensation may be payable at time of sale. In any event, these issues should be addressed in the terms of sale. When applicable, deferred compensation could be a critical retirement planning factor to a selling owner and he or she will want to make sure receipt of these benefits are as secure as possible.</p>

<h4>Consulting Contract</h4>

<h4>SCINS and Private Annuities</h4>
<p>If the seller accepts a SCIN or Private Annuity as payment in a family sale, the risk of death prior to full payment on the note should be a risk that the seller can afford to take. Motivation for this arrangement probably is primarily driven by accommodating a family member&rsquo;s ability to purchase the business.</p>

<h4>Cash or Installment Sale of the Business</h4>
<p>A <em>cash sale</em> certainly is the cleanest and easiest business transfer method to evaluate for retirement planning purposes. Cash is in hand, taxes must be paid resulting from the sale, and the seller knows how much net cash is available to invest and apply to debt or to any other financial needs that arise.</p>
<p>An <em>installment sale</em> has similar ramifications to a cash sale except the receipt of payments and tax liabilities from the sale are spread out over time. The seller incurs the risk of a creditor.</p>
