<p>As illustrated in the Family Limited Partnership case study, discounted values can be quite useful in facilitating intra-family transfers.&nbsp; Another technique that can be helpful in making transfers at discounted gift tax valuations is a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT).&nbsp; A <strong>Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)</strong> is a technique where the grantor (donor) transfers property (or other assets) into an irrevocable trust which, in turn, will provide the grantor with a cash annuity payment for a pre-determined period of time.&nbsp; Once the annuity obligation to the grantor has been fulfilled, the beneficiaries of the trust will receive the balance that is remaining in the trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key advantages of using a GRAT are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) A retained income flow,<br /> 2) Transfer of assets to beneficiaries at a reduced valuation, and <br /> 3) Transferring some or all of the appreciation out of the donor&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>5</h4>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Assume George wants to gift $500,000 of stock to a GRAT from which he wishes to receive an income of $50,000 per year for a duration of 5 years. At the end of five years, the remaining principal passes to George&rsquo;s three children. If the IRC Section 7250 rate is 2%, then the present value of George&rsquo;s retained annuity is $235,673. Thus, for gift tax purposes, the value of George&rsquo;s gift to the trust is $500,000 - $235,673 = $264,327. Let&rsquo;s further assume that the total return on the stock is 12% per year. At the end of the 5 years, net of the annual distributions back to George, the remainder beneficiaries will receive $563,528.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>This is not<strong> </strong>a gift of present interest (the remainder beneficiaries do not presently receive anything), thus the annual gift tax exclusion is not available. George will have to rely on his lifetime gift tax exclusion (currently $5.43 million in 2015, as indexed) to avoid paying a gift tax.</p>
