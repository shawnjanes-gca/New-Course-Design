<p>A final technique we shall consider for transfers to family members is an <strong><em>Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)</em></strong>.&nbsp; Ordinarily, a <strong><em>Grantor Trust </em></strong>is one in which the grantor (the person creating the trust) is treated as the owner of the trust for both income tax purposes AND estate tax purposes.&nbsp; However, an Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT) is an irrevocable trust in which the grantor is treated as the owner for income tax purposes but NOT as the owner for estate tax purposes.&nbsp; In other words, the grantor is taxed on all trust income, but the assets themselves are outside the grantor&rsquo;s estate for estate tax purposes.</p>
<p>This provides a significant planning opportunity for individuals who want to reduce the size of their taxable estates while also transferring their business interest to family members.&nbsp; In a manner similar to a SCIN, the grantor creates the trust and sells the business interest to the trust in exchange for an installment note.&nbsp; The note should be for a predetermined period of time and can be self-amortizing or can be interest only with a balloon payment at the end of the term.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Outside Financing</h4>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Peter Patriarch owns all of the outstanding stock of Patriarch Throne Co., Inc., which totals 1,000 shares of common stock. Patriarch Throne&rsquo;s Board decides to recapitalize the corporation. It has been determined by professional valuation that the company is worth $10,000,000. The corporation issues 9,000 shares of new preferred stock with a par value of $1000 per share and a cumulative dividend of $60.00 per year or a 6% yield (assumed current market rate). Peter exchanges 900 shares of his common stock worth $9,000,000 for 9,000 shares of the preferred stock worth $9,000,000.</p>
<p>Peter then gifts (or sells) his $1,000,000 of common stock to his son Paul, who is an officer of the company working in the business. (Employment or relationship of Paul is not necessary to make transaction work &ndash; we are assuming here that he Peter wants to transfer ownership to his son who is actively involved in the business).</p>
<p>Peter has accomplished three primary objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Peter has transferred a business interest to his son at little or no cost to the son.</li>
<li>Peter has a relatively predictable income stream for retirement.</li>
<li>Peter has &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; the value of his business interest at $9,000,000 vs. allowing the value of the common stock to continue to increase the value of his estate.</li>
