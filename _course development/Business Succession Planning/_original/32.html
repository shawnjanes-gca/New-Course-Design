<p>Sometimes the best option for a business succession plan is to transfer the business to the employees and/or management of the business.&nbsp; The owner&rsquo;s sense of commitment to long-time employees may also be a factor that makes this option more attractive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This section will discuss four methods of transfer commonly used with employees and management:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cash or Installment Sale by Owner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Leveraged Buyout (LBO)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock Bonus Plan</p>

<h4>Financing the transfer</h4>
<p>Purchases of family businesses are usually financed with a combination of loans and equity.&nbsp; The components often come from different sources.&nbsp; Depending on its size and complexity, the financing package can be assembled by a bank, commercial finance company, business broker, or investment banker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the purchase may involve an installment loan financed by the seller. If the purchaser is a large company, the purchase may also be accomplished in the form of debentures or bonds.</p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Structuring the purchase</h4>
<p>A business transfer to a third party can be structured in a number of ways.&nbsp; Usually, a significant amount of negotiation is required to agree on the structure (e.g., stock purchase versus an asset purchase) since it has important tax, legal, and business consequences for all parties.&nbsp; Not only must the parties decide what they want from the deal (e.g., stock or assets, liability protection, etc.), they must quantify how much they are willing to pay for it (usually in the form of a price adjustment).&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Evaluating the business</h4>
<p>In addition to the seller&rsquo;s evaluation of the purchaser&rsquo;s qualifications, the purchaser should evaluate the business.&nbsp; The keys to an effective business evaluation are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Having reliable information</strong>.&nbsp; Information gathering should begin as soon as the purchaser begins to consider buying the business.&nbsp; Information should be obtained from several sources, including the company, vendor, and customers.&nbsp; This information can be used to verify, compare, contrast and discover data about the owner, industry, business being acquired, and competitors.&nbsp; Of particular interest is information the seller may be reluctant to disclose (e.g., pending regulatory requirements, competition, etc.).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>A well-prepared, experienced evaluation team.</strong>&nbsp; Members of the evaluation team might include CPAs, attorneys, finance specialists, valuation specialists, environmental specialists, and investment bankers.&nbsp; It is important that people familiar with business valuation techniques are involved and that they use a disciplined valuation approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Business evaluation sounds simple, but in practice the effort is intense and compressed into a relatively short amount of time.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Performing due diligence</h4>
<p><strong><em>Due diligence</em></strong> refers to the process of conducting an investigation to determine the full implications of a proposed transaction.&nbsp; One goal is to make sure the buyer and lenders know exactly what they are getting into.&nbsp; However, it can also benefit the seller by giving assurance that the buyers possess the skills and financing needed to successfully run the business and, therefore, repay any seller-financing. It also helps make sure that the seller understands the tax consequences of the sale.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, the primary lender prescribes the nature and extent of the due diligence required.&nbsp; The purchaser and the seller are generally already familiar with much of the information obtained in a due diligence review.&nbsp; Nevertheless, due diligence can uncover issues of which neither side is aware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is prudent for all parties involved (buyer, seller, and lenders) to agree in advance on the experts to use for due diligence.&nbsp; Agreeing on valuation, environmental, and legal experts will avoid the expense of each party hiring its own (although each party will probably want to retain separate legal counsel for negotiation purposes).&nbsp;</p>
