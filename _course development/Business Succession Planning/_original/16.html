<h4>Life Insurance</h4>
<p><strong><em>Life Insurance</em></strong> &ndash;Each buyer purchases life insurance on the seller in the amount of the purchase price. If permanent coverage is used and the policies are in force for several years, cash values could be used to assist in a lifetime buy-out and/or death proceeds used to ultimately repay a buy-out loan. Premiums could be paid by the buyer or a split-dollar plan could be arranged with the company to assist the buyer(s) with the cash outlay required by the premiums. Note that if the deceased owner's interest is purchased from an heir, the heir realizes a stepped-up basis in the value of the business interest that he or she sells. In contrast, if an owner's interest is purchased while they are living, the seller does not realize a stepped-up basis and may realize a capital gain.</p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer and stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, he would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business. This capital gain may receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 20% tax rate, but AMT and state taxes may apply), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $180,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 39.6%). After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $720,000.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Bargain Sale</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>bargain sale</em></strong> is a sale of property for less than full fair market value.&nbsp; The consideration received by the seller represents the sale, and the excess value transferred is considered a gift.&nbsp; For example, a business owner may wish to transfer a $1,000,000 business to an adult child, but needs income to provide support during retirement.&nbsp; Rather than selling for $1,000,000, the owner might sell for $400,000, making a gift of the balance.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Self-Cancelling Installment Note (SCIN)</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>Self-Cancelling Installment Note (SCIN)</em></strong> is an installment note that is specifically designed with a cancellation-at-death provision in the note. This has the benefit of relieving the family member buyer of making future payments if the seller dies before the loan is paid in full.&nbsp; Its further benefit is that, since the note has zero value at death, NO VALUE is included in the seller&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>This type of note must be designed carefully to avoid falling into unintended tax traps. Due to the forgiveness feature in the event of premature death, the size of the note must be increased and/or the interest rate must be increased over market rates to reflect the increased risk of limited repayment to the seller/creditor. <span class="style2"><strong>Click <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer11','','show')" href="javascript:void(0);">here</a></span></strong><strong> to read a case study involving a SCIN.</strong></span></p>

<h4>Private Annuity</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>Private Annuity </em></strong>is very similar to an installment sale except the payments are calculated differently. For example, if we assume Joe, Jr. is purchasing Widgets, Inc. from Joe, Sr. for $1,000,000, Joe, Jr. would make a fixed payment to Joe, Sr. for as long as Joe, Sr. lives. The amount of the payment is determined by IRS prescribed market interest rates at the time of the sale and Joe, Sr.&rsquo;s life expectancy. &nbsp;If Joe, Sr. dies before the full $1,000,000 plus interest is recovered, Joe, Jr. has effectively received a discount. &nbsp;If Joe, Sr. lives longer than the prescribed life expectancy Joe, Sr. receives a premium for the sale of the business.</p>
<p>One primary advantage of this approach, unlike an installment loan, is that none of the business value is included in Joe, Sr.&rsquo;s estate regardless of when he dies. &nbsp;Another advantage may be that Joe, Sr. receives a retirement income that he cannot outlive (as long as Joe, Jr. is able to make the payments).</p>
<p>Caution is warranted if the annuity is purchased with non-cash assets, such as appreciated securities. Under current law, all of the capital gain imbedded in the appreciated securities is recognized for income tax purposes immediately in the year the annuity is purchased. This caution does not apply to Private Annuities purchased for cash.</p>

<h4>Asset Sale</h4>
<p><strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong> &ndash; From a tax standpoint, the sale of a sole proprietorship is actually a sale of specified assets. All of the previously listed funding methods could be utilized. The only likely difference is the tax ramifications. The seller may incur some ordinary income tax liability upon sale of the business, but most of the gain, if any, will be taxed at capital gain rates.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships</strong> -<strong> </strong>Partnership tax issues in the event of a lifetime or after death sale are more complex and beyond the scope of this course, but are similar to those of a sole proprietor.</p>
<p><strong>Corporation</strong> &ndash; In some situations, the younger family members may want to purchase certain assets of the business prior to or in concert with a plan to purchase the company stock. &nbsp;For example, a son in the business may wish to purchase real estate, equipment, etc., from the corporation and lease it to the business or possibly to another entity. This type of purchase could provide the buyer with tax-advantaged cash flow and possibly remove an appreciating asset from the business.</p>

<h4>Buy-Sell Agreement</h4>
<p>A <em><strong>Buy-Sell Agreement</strong></em> is a formal agreement whereby one party agrees to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and the other party agrees to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; an ownership interest in the company at an agreed upon price upon the occurrence of a triggering event (e.g., death, disability, or retirement).&nbsp; Entering into a Buy-Sell Agreement can be particularly appealing as a means of facilitating an intra-family sale if those involved in the agreement are active shareholders/partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Agreement is structured such that the business entity is to purchase the outgoing owner&rsquo;s interest in the business, the &ldquo;family attribution rules&rdquo; can come into play, which can cause the purchase payment to be taxed as dividends to the selling shareholder.&nbsp; For this reason, such Agreements, when involving family members, will generally be structured so that family members agree to purchase the shares directly from the existing owner at an agreed price with specified terms.</p>
<p>Typically, the main obstacle to this type of purchase is the ability of the buyer(s) to come up with the funds to purchase the company. They typically have six funding options:&nbsp; <span class="style1">Click each funding option to learn more.</span></p>
