<h2>Lifetime Gifts to Family Members</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the unique characteristics of transfers to family members is the possible desire to make the transfers as gifts rather than sales.&nbsp; Lifetime gifts of a business interest differ from a sale in two primary ways:<strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The donor does not receive any cash or compensation for the gift, thus providing no funds to produce income for the owner or to fund any personal objectives or needs.&nbsp; In fact, gifts may actually cause a cash outflow if a gift tax is incurred, since the donor is responsible for filing a gift tax return and paying any tax due.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gifts reduce the size of the donor&rsquo;s estate by the amount of the gift plus any appreciation that the business interest may realize after the gift is made.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two key gift tax exclusions available to facilitate transfers through gifts.&nbsp; <span class="style2"><strong>Click each exclusion to learn more.</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="javascript:void(0);">Annual Gift Tax Exclusion</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="javascript:void(0);">Lifetime Gift Tax Exclusion</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One disadvantage of making gifts during life, rather than waiting to transfer assets at death, is that the tax basis of gifted shares would be the basis of the donor.&nbsp; In contrast, if the shares are transferred at death, the basis is stepped up to the current fair market value as of death (or 6 months later, if the executor so elects).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that when making gifts, the donor will need to establish a credible value of the business interest being transferred. These valuations or appraisals will likely result in extra costs to the donor.&nbsp; The valuations, however, may allow for discounted values due to the limited marketability of a closely held company and/or due to the gifted shares representing a minority interest.</p>
<p>Also, note that gifts of an interest in a pass-through entity, such as an S Corporation, will result not only in transfer of ownership rights but also in transfer of profits (or losses) to the donee. &nbsp;This may not be the case with transfers of shares in a C Corporation, since a C Corporation may or may not choose to pay dividends (at the discretion of the majority owners).</p>

<h4>Installment Sale</h4>
<p><strong><em>Installment Sale</em></strong> &ndash; An installment sale (which can be done with or without a buy-sell agreement) works just like a cash sale except that the payments are financed by the seller. This eases the burden of payments on the buyer, stretches out the tax liability to the seller. The seller has some risk of default.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an installment sale removes the value of the potentially <em>appreciating value of the company </em>from the seller&rsquo;s estate. The balance of the loan still receivable at the seller&rsquo;s death, if any, would be in the seller&rsquo;s estate, but any appreciation in the value of the company would be removed from his or her estate.</p>

<h4>Case Study &ndash; SCIN</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith (the seller) is 65 years old and wishes to transfer to his children an interest in the family business that has a current fair market value of $1,000,000 and a cost basis of $100,000. [Note: in computing the fair market value of the business interest, one must consider the discount for lack of control and discount for lack of marketability to determine if each are appropriate.&nbsp; If either is appropriate, such discount will be passed along to the buyer.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
If Mr. Smith sells the interest in the business outright to his children, Mr. Smith would report a $900,000 capital gain on the sale of the interest in the family business.&nbsp; This capital gain would most likely receive favorable tax treatment for federal income tax purposes (most likely at the 15% tax rate), which in this case would mean a federal tax liability of $135,000 (assuming there is neither depreciation recapture nor any other ordinary income assets; otherwise, the tax rates could be 25% to 35%).&nbsp; After taxes, Mr. Smith would net $765,000.
<p>Instead, Mr. Smith decides to use a SCIN with a 10-year, self-amortizing installment note at a 5% minimum annual interest rate (determined by the IRS) and a $100,000 down payment from his children.&nbsp; To adjust for the self-cancelling feature, either the price or the interest rate must be adjusted.&nbsp; If the purchase price premium method is used, the purchase price must be increased from $1,000,000 to approximately $1,528,300, with annual payments of $114,600 per year to account for the cancellation provision of the note.&nbsp; If the interest rate premium method is used, then the annual interest rate would be increased from the 5% minimum to at least 12.5% (a spread of 7.5% also determined by the IRS), with annual payments of $124,900 per year.</p>
<p>The key component of the SCIN is the term of the installment note.&nbsp; The term must be less than Mr. Smith&rsquo;s remaining life expectancy in order to avoid private annuity treatment.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith dies before the term of the note, then the children may have paid far less than fair market value and the asset will have transferred to them with no estate or gift taxes.&nbsp; If Mr. Smith lives beyond the term of the note, then the terms of the note will have been met in full; however, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s children will have paid more than the fair market value of family business interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Bargain Sale</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>bargain sale</em></strong> is a sale of property for less than full fair market value.&nbsp; The consideration received by the seller represents the sale, and the excess value transferred is considered a gift.&nbsp; For example, a business owner may wish to transfer a $1,000,000 business to an adult child, but needs income to provide support during retirement.&nbsp; Rather than selling for $1,000,000, the owner might sell for $400,000, making a gift of the balance.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lifetime Gift Tax Exclusion</h4>
<p>An individual can also make gifts in excess of the annual exclusion that are subject to gift tax. However, there is a cumulative lifetime gift tax credit available to each taxpayer that totals $2,117,800 (in 2015, as indexed), which is equivalent to an exclusion of $5,430,000 of gifted assets (in 2015, as indexed). For example, a married couple could join together in making a tax-free gift of a $10,860,000 business interest (plus additional annual exclusion gifts), assuming neither spouse had made prior taxable gifts.</p>
<p>Note again that not only would the size of the donor&rsquo;s estate be reduced by the value of the gifted business interest, any <strong><em>growth</em></strong> in business value is transferred out of the estate of the donor as well.</p>

<h4>Private Annuity</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>Private Annuity </em></strong>is very similar to an installment sale except the payments are calculated differently. For example, if we assume Joe, Jr. is purchasing Widgets, Inc. from Joe, Sr. for $1,000,000, Joe, Jr. would make a fixed payment to Joe, Sr. for as long as Joe, Sr. lives. The amount of the payment is determined by IRS prescribed market interest rates at the time of the sale and Joe, Sr.&rsquo;s life expectancy. &nbsp;If Joe, Sr. dies before the full $1,000,000 plus interest is recovered, Joe, Jr. has effectively received a discount. &nbsp;If Joe, Sr. lives longer than the prescribed life expectancy Joe, Sr. receives a premium for the sale of the business.</p>
<p>One primary advantage of this approach, unlike an installment loan, is that none of the business value is included in Joe, Sr.&rsquo;s estate regardless of when he dies. &nbsp;Another advantage may be that Joe, Sr. receives a retirement income that he cannot outlive (as long as Joe, Jr. is able to make the payments).</p>

<h4>Asset Sale</h4>
<p><strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong> &ndash; From a tax standpoint, the sale of a sole proprietorship is actually a sale of specified assets. All of the previously listed funding methods could be utilized. The only likely difference is the tax ramifications. The seller may incur some ordinary income tax liability upon sale of the business, but most of the gain, if any, will be taxed at capital gain rates.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships</strong> -<strong> </strong>Partnership tax issues in the event of a lifetime or after death sale are more complex and beyond the scope of this course, but are similar to those of a sole proprietor.</p>
<p><strong>Corporation</strong> &ndash; In some situations, the younger family members may want to purchase certain assets of the business prior to or in concert with a plan to purchase the company stock. &nbsp;For example, a son in the business may wish to purchase real estate, equipment, etc., from the corporation and lease it to the business or possibly to another entity. This type of purchase could provide the buyer with tax-advantaged cash flow and possibly remove an appreciating asset from the business.</p>

<h4>Annual Gift Tax Exclusion</h4>
<p>Gifts to any person within the <strong><em>annual exclusion</em></strong> ($14,000 in 2015, as indexed) are excluded from gift taxation. A husband and wife can &ldquo;split gifts&rdquo;, thereby combining their annual exclusions to gift up to twice the annual exclusion amount ($28,000 in 2015, as indexed), regardless of which spouse actually provides the funds. The only requirement is that the gift be of a &ldquo;present interest,&rdquo; meaning the donee must take receipt of the gift and the benefits of ownership.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, gifting small increments of a sole proprietorship, partnership or an LLC can be difficult. Gifting of a sole proprietorship interest involves specific assets of varying values, and partnerships require approval of other partners or members. Gifting of corporate stock is much simpler.</p>
<p>Annually gifting small portions of stock (covered by the annual gift tax exclusion) can add up to substantial amounts over time. In addition to reducing the size of the donor&rsquo;s estate by the value of the stock at the time of transfer, any <strong><em>growth</em></strong> in business value is transferred out of the estate of the donor as well, thus possibly reducing transfer taxes. For example, if a husband and wife joined in making transfers of stock to two children over 10 years, this would result in $560,000 of gifts. In addition, if the stock&rsquo;s value appreciated at 6% per year, at the end of ten years, the donor would have removed more than $700,000 of asset value from his or her estate.</p>
