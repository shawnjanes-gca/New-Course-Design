<p>A primary issue for consideration in business succession planning is the selection and grooming of a potential successor(s).&nbsp; Questions to be answered include:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Who will ultimately be responsible for leading the business?</li>
<li>Will there be more than one leader?</li>
<li>How will the owner transfer business or industry-specific knowledge over to the new leadership?</li>
</ul>
<p>From a group of potential candidates, the owner(s) must assess the candidates&rsquo; skills, experience, and leadership abilities against those required by the business.</p>
<p>The process does not stop with simply identifying the successor.&nbsp; One of the most critical aspects of the succession process is making sure that the successor is ready to take control of the company when called upon to do so.&nbsp; Many of the reasons for business failure that were previously listed are a direct result of the successor not being properly trained to manage the business.&nbsp; Thus, the potential successor should be equipped with knowledge of the company&rsquo;s financials and operations, as well as the policies and procedures that have been established to make the business operate efficiently.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Compensatory Transfers</h4>
<p>An owner can transfer an unrestricted partnership interest as a form of compensation for services rendered, (i.e., a compensatory transfer).&nbsp; Since it is a form of compensation, it triggers immediate taxable income for the recipient equal to the fair market value of the interest received, reduced by the amount paid, if any.&nbsp; This compensation is deductible to the partnership or LLC.</p>

<h4>Limited Partnership</h4>
<p>A <strong><em>Limited Partnership </em></strong>offers more protection from liability, as limited partners are liable for partnership debts only up to the amount of the partner&rsquo;s capital contributions.&nbsp; A Limited Partnership still has one or more general partners, who are still liable for all partnership liabilities and have full management control of the business.</p>
<p>A Limited Partnership is also a &ldquo;pass-through entity&rdquo; for tax purposes &ndash; the Limited Partnership is not a separate taxable entity.</p>

<h4>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h4>
<p>The characteristics of a <strong><em>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</em></strong> vary based on differences in state laws. The LLC is a legal entity that can be formed by drafting articles of organization and submitting them to an appropriate state agency. An LLC can be treated as a Corporation (any number of members), a Partnership (at least two members), and, in most states, as a Sole Proprietorship (one member) for federal income tax purposes. In all states, however, unlike a General Partnership, no partner is liable for the malpractice of any of the other partners.&nbsp; Thus, an LLC combines the limited liability of a corporation with the benefits of flexibility in tax treatment that is enjoyed by partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Selling or Liquidating an Interest</h4>
<p>Similar to the C Corporation, the interest in the business can be sold or the departing partner/member can liquidate his or her interest back to the company, effectively resulting in a transfer of ownership to the remaining partners/members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the departing partner(s)/member(s) can sell its assets to the successor(s).&nbsp; Often, after an asset sale, the sales proceeds are distributed to the successor owner(s) in complete liquidation of the partnership.</p>
