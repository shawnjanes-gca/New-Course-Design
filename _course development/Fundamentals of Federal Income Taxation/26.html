  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Effective for 2013 and later tax years, a 3.8% tax is assessed against investment  income. The purpose of the NIIT is to provide additional funding to Medicare. This tax marks the first time in our nation's history that <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Investment income for purposes of the NIIT is comprised of  more than merely portfolio income and includes all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dividends&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capital gains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rental and royalty income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income from annuities purchased with the taxpayer's after-tax dollars (referred to as nonqualified annuities)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income from certain businesses (e.g., Limited Partnerships, Sub S Corporations, and Limited Liability  Companies) in which the taxpayer is not actively involved in the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">investment income</a> has been subject to Medicare taxes.</p>
  <p>The NIIT is also referred to as the 3.8% Medicare Surtax or 3.8% Additional Medicare Tax. This tax is payable on the<strong> lesser of</strong> net investment income or modified adjusted gross income in excess of the following thresholds. Modified adjusted gross income will generally be equal to adjusted gross income as normally calculated for most taxpayers.</p>

<p>The calculation of this tax is best illustrated by example. Assume that your clients are married and file jointly. Their adjusted gross income is $400,000. They have investment income of $210,000 and investment expenses of $10,000. Their net investment income tax is $5,700 calculated as follows</p>
