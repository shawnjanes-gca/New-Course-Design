  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet - Line 44</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Most of your clients will have ordinary income, qualified dividends, and capital gains and losses. Since different rates are involved, just how is this all pulled together? You may also recall that earlier, when figuring gross income, we included capital gains and qualified dividends. That means that they are included in taxable income as well. How, then, do we now apply different tax rates when everything has been added together?</p>
  <p>For many taxpayers who have qualified dividends and/or capital gains, this will be accomplished with the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gains Tax Worksheet â€“ Line 44. More information is available at <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsPublications.html" target="_blank">IRS Forms and Publications</a> (search for <em>Form 1040 Schedule D</em>).</p>
  <p>The worksheet makes it possible to back out the qualified dividends and capital gains, thereby calculating the tax on them at their appropriate rates, and then calculating the tax on the balance according to the tax rate schedule for ordinary income. </p>
  <p>What does this worksheet accomplish? No matter how high a taxpayer's income, long-term capital gains will be taxed at long-term capital gain rates instead of ordinary income rates.</p>
