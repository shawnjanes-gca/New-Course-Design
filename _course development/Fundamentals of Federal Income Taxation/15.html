  <p>The final issue we will explore regarding the recognition of unearned income is the taxation of annuities. Income from <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Annuities are contracts (typically insurance contracts) that may provide income as a series of regular payments for a specific period of time or for life. A portion of each annuity payment is considered a return of capital.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">annuities</a> is reported on line 16a of Form 1040. </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="greene/fundamentals_of_federal_income_taxation/images/Annuities.png" width="592" height="175" alt=""/></p>
  <p>When  an individual receives annuity payments, part of the annuity income payments  will be included or excluded from taxable income. The portion of income  payments that is excluded from taxation is determined by calculating the <strong><em>exclusion  ratio</em></strong>.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  <table>
  	<tr>
    	<td rowspan="2">Exclusion Ratio</td>
        <td rowspan="2">=</td>
        <td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; vertical-align:bottom;">Investment in Contract</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	
        <td style="vertical-align:top;">Expected Return</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </div><!--example box-->
  <p>If the number of payments is known, then the expected return in the equation is simply the total of all the income payments. If it is a life annuity, then you total all the income payments within the annuitant's life expectancy.</p>
<p>Once the exclusion ratio is determined, you simply multiply an income payment by the exclusion ratio to derive the amount of the income payment that is excluded from taxable income. This portion is simply a return of the investment in the annuity.</p>
<div class="example-box">
	<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Excluded Amount = Exclusion Ratio x Income Payment</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Once the excluded amount is determined, then the taxable amount is simply the balance.  Generally, payments received after the investment in the contract is recovered are fully included in income. This is best illustrated by the example below.</p>

<div class="example-box">
