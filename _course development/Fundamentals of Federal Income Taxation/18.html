<p>On line 27 of Form 1040, an individual is allowed to deduct <strong><em>one-half of the net self-employment income tax</em></strong>. The self-employment income tax is comprised of a Social Security (OASDI) tax and Medicare tax. The Social Security tax is 12.4%, and Medicare 2.9%. Therefore, the total tax is 15.3% of net earnings from self-employment. However, the maximum amount of income subject to the Social Security tax is $118,500 in tax year 2015. There is no maximum for the Medicare tax.</p>
