              <p>On  line 27 of Form 1040, an individual is allowed to deduct <strong><em>one-half</em></strong> <strong><em>of  the net self-employment income tax</em></strong>. The self-employment income tax is  comprised of a Social Security (OASDI) tax and Medicare tax. The Social  Security tax is 12.4%, and Medicare 2.9%. Therefore, the total tax is 15.3% of  net earnings from self-employment. However, the maximum amount of income  subject to the Social Security tax is $118,500 in tax year 2016. There is no  maximum for the Medicare tax. </p>
