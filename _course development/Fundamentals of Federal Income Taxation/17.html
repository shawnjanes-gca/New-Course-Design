  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Adjusted Gross Income</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
   <p>Once gross income is identified, the next step is to derive adjusted gross income  (AGI) through a series of deductions. This is done in the bottom section of the  front page of Form 1040, which can be viewed on this page. These adjustments are often referred to as "<strong><em>adjustments FOR AGI</em></strong>" as they are adjustments that are made to derive AGI. Adjustments that will be made on the back of Form 1040, after AGI has been derived, are frequently referred to as "<strong><em>adjustments FROM AGI</em></strong>."</p>

  <p>Take a few moments to look over the list of deductions available.  The titles are fairly descriptive of the nature of the deductions. Three areas you are likely to encounter are:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Line 27,28, and 29 – Self-Employed Deductions</li>
	<li>Line 31a – Alimony paid (not child support)</li>
	<li>Line 32 – IRA Deduction</li>
  </ul>
 
  <p>We will take a closer look at the first two of these on the next two pages.</p>
