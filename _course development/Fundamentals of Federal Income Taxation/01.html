  <p>The goal of this course is to better equip you to help your clients make tax-informed investment and planning decisions.</p>
  <p>Individual income taxes are computed and filed on Form 1040 (or on the simpler 1040A or 1040EZ forms for eligible taxpayers). The 1040 and its associated schedules can be quite intimidating.</p>
  <p>Yet familiarity with the form and how income taxes are computed can provide invaluable understanding regarding the tax implications of decisions you may make personally or advice you may offer when working with wealthy clients. As we discuss each of the primary components of the tax return, we will also highlight some of the issues that are most relevant to financial services professionals who work with high net worth clients.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3 style="color:red;">Compliance Alert</h3>
    <p>Remember, you must neither perform income tax calculations nor prepare income tax returns for your clients; that should be left to a CPA, CFPÂ® professional, or other qualified tax advisor. Your role is to raise planning awareness for follow up with a professional tax advisor. </p>
