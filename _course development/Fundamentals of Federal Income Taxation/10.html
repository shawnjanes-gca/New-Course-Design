  <h1><span class="pagetitle">When to Recognize Gains and Losses</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A <em><strong>realized gain or loss</strong></em> is the actual gain or loss realized on the sale of an asset.  Until a sale occurs, there are only adjustments to basis. For example, assume Terri buys an acre of land for $10,000.  Three years later, it is worth $12,000. If Terri keeps the land, she simply has a basis of $10,000. However, if she decides to sell it, she would use her basis to calculate a realized gain of $2,000. If she sold it through a realtor, who charged a $750 commission, this would reduce Terry's gain, resulting in a realized gain of $1,250.</p>
<p>Part, all, or none of the realized gain or loss upon the sale of an asset will be recognized.  The <em><strong>recognized gain or loss</strong></em> is the portion of the realized gain or loss that is considered in the computation of tax liability. Therefore, "recognition" generally means that the result of a transaction is considered to be taxable. </p> 
<p>Generally speaking, unless investment assets are held in a tax-deferred retirement plan, all of the realized gain and loss in investment accounts will be recognized, although some of the net losses may be carried forward to future years (as will be discussed further). But be careful, because this does not apply for all assets. For example, provided certain <em><strong>conditions</strong></em> are met, taxpayers can currently exclude from taxation $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing jointly) of capital gain on the sale of their principal residence. This special exclusion rule may only be used to exclude the gain from a sale of a principal residence once every two years.</p>

                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Dale bought a home in three years ago for $230,000. Dale lived in the home for three years, selling it in the current year for $320,000. Would Dale include the gain as taxable income?</p>
				<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Dale would NOT include the gain of $90,000 as taxable income when he sells the home.</p>
				<p><strong>Question: </strong>What if Dale sells the home for $190,000?  Would he be able to deduct the loss? </p> 
				<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The answer is no. This is a personal loss, for which there is no deduction.</p>
