<p>With most securities, it is easy to identify when capital gains occur. When a stock or bond is sold, a gain or loss occurs. But options can be a bit trickier because there are several different scenarios whereby capital gains and losses may occur. Therefore, it is worth taking a closer look at how option transactions are reported.</p>
<h4>What is an option?</h4>
<p>In its simplest form, an option is the right to buy or sell <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show','Layer2','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;">property</a></strong></span> at an agreed price. One party writes (creates) the option; the other party purchases the option. An expiration date is specified in the option agreement, after which all rights to buy or sell the underlying property is forfeited.</p>

<h3><strong>Example</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Ryan purchases an option to buy 1,000 shares of ABC Corporation stock on June 10 at an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','hide','Layer2','','show')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;">exercise price</a></strong></span> of $25. On June 10, ABC Corporation stock is trading at $30. Should Ryan exercise the option?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><em> Yes. Ryan would exercise the option because he is purchasing shares for $25.00/share that are worth $30.00/share.</em></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What if the shares were trading at $20 on June 10?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><em> In that case, Ryan would not exercise the option and would lose the fee he paid for the option.</em></p>

<h4>How are options taxed?</h4>
<p>The writing or purchase of an option is not a taxable event. How the option will be ultimately handled for tax purposes will depend upon whether the option is resold prior to expiration, expires unexercised, or is exercised. Let's examine each situation.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In many cases, an option is sold from one buyer to another buyer before its expiration date. The gain or loss from the sale or exchange of an option is of the same character as the property to which the option relates. Therefore, if the option were on a capital asset, the gain or loss would be treated as a capital gain or loss. Whether it is short-term or long-term would depend upon the period for which the option was held.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Dave purchased an option on 100 shares of XYZ Corp for a premium of $500. The option has an expiration date of May 10th. Prior to May 10th, Dave sells the option for $600. In that case, Dave would report a capital gain of $100.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>When an option expires unexercised, it is treated just as a resale of the option. Upon expiration, the holder of the option would have a capital loss in the amount of the premium that was paid for the option, which is long-term or short-term depending on the holding period of the option, and the writer of the option would have a short-term capital gain in the amount of the premium received.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>On May 10th, Dave allowed the option to expire unexercised. Dave would report a capital loss of $500 and the writer of the option would report a capital gain of $500.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>A <strong><em>call option</em></strong> gives the holder of the option the right to buy the underlying security at the exercise price; the writer of the call is obligated to deliver the security. The basis of the acquired asset will be the exercise price plus the premium paid (plus any commissions). The writer of the call, in determining gain or loss on sale of the asset, will add the amount of the premium received for the option to the price paid for the security (but may deduct any commission expense). The gain or loss will be short-term or long-term depending upon how long the security was held.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Let's assume Dave's option on XYZ stock was a call option to buy 100 shares with an exercise price of $50 per share. If Dave exercises the option, he will pay $5,000 for the 100 shares. Ignoring any commissions, Dave's basis in the newly acquired shares will be the $5,000 he paid for the shares plus the $500 he paid for the option to purchase them, or $5,500.</p>
<p>The writer of the option received a premium of $500 on the option and received $5,000 upon selling the shares. Thus, the writer had a total receipt of $5,500. If the writer's basis in the shares had been $2,000, then the writer would have a $3,500 capital gain upon the sale of the shares (ignoring any possible commissions involved).</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_4" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Put Option</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>A <strong><em>put option</em></strong> gives the holder of the option the right to sell the underlying security to the writer of the option at the exercise price; the writer is obligated to buy the security. When a put option is exercised, the holder of the option will determine gain or loss by deducting from the exercise price the amount of the premium paid. The basis of the security acquired by the writer of the put will be the exercise price minus the premium received for writing the option (plus any commissions paid.)</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Let's assume Dave's option on XYZ stock was a put option to sell 100 shares with an exercise price of $50 per share. If Dave exercises the option, he will sell his shares to the option writer for $5,000. But Dave had to pay $500 for the put option, which allowed him to sell them at the exercise price, so he gets to reduce the proceeds by that amount. Ignoring commissions and assuming his basis in the shares was $2,000, Dave would then have a capital gain of $2,500 ($4,500 - $2,000).</p>
<p>The writer of the put option has to pay $5,000 for the 100 shares of XYZ stock. But since the writer also received a premium of $500 when writing the option, the writer must reduce his basis by the $500 premium. Thus, the writer's basis in the shares is $4,500.</p>
