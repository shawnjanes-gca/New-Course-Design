  <p>With most securities, it is easy to identify when capital gains occur. When a stock or bond is sold, a gain or loss occurs.  But options can be a bit trickier because there are several different scenarios whereby capital gains and losses may occur. Therefore, it is worth taking a closer look at how option transactions are reported.</p>
  <h3>What is an option?
  <p>In its simplest form, an option is the right to buy or sell <a href="#">property</a> at an agreed price.  One party writes (creates) the option; the other party purchases the option. An expiration date is specified in the option agreement, after which all rights to buy or sell the underlying property is forfeited.</p>
  <p>And so forth...</p>
