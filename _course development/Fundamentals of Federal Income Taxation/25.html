  </h1>
  <p>After reducing AGI by the standard or itemized deductions, and by personal and dependent exemptions, the resulting Taxable Income (line 43) is used to calculate the taxpayer's Tentative Tax, and the result is entered on line 44.  View this portion of the tax return below.</p>

  <p>The marginal tax rate system is used to compute this tax.  The first thing to understand about this system is that individuals will be placed in certain tax brackets (tax rates) based on their income and filing status. The 2016 federal brackets are as follows:</p>
  <div class="example-box" style="width:50%">
  <p><strong>2016 Marginal Income Tax Rates (Brackets)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  	<li>10%</li>
	<li>15%</li>
	<li>25%</li>
	<li>28%</li>
	<li>33%	</li>
    <li>35%</li>
	<li>39.6%</li>
  </ul>
  
  </div><!--Example box-->
  <p>Depending upon filing status, these marginal rates are assigned to different incremental levels of Taxable Income. An individual's total taxable income will NOT all be taxed at the highest bracket reached. Rather, only the amount of income that is within the range assigned to a marginal rate will be taxed at that particular rate.</p>
  
  <p>View the example below.</p>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">
    <h3>Example</h3>
     <p>The following example should help clear up any confusion.</p>
     <p>The 2016 Marginal Tax Rates for unmarried individuals (other  than surviving spouses and heads of households) are listed below, along with  the ranges to which they apply:</p>
    <ul style="list-style:none">
    	<li>10% on amounts up to $9,275</li>
      	<li>15% on amounts over $9,275 and up to $37,650</li>
      	<li>25% on amounts over $37,650 and up to $91,150</li>
     	<li>28% on amounts over $91,150 and up to $190,150</li>
     	<li>33% on amounts over $190,150 and up to $413,350</li>
      	<li>35% on amounts over $413,350 and up to $415,050</li>
      	<li>39.6% on amounts over $415,050</li>
     </ul>
    <p>Another way of looking at it is:</p>
      <ul style="list-style:none;">
      <li>10% on the first $9,275</li>
      <li>15% on the next $28,375 (This equals $37,650  - $9,275)</li>
      <li>25% on the next $53,500 (This equals $91,150  - $37,650)</li>
      <li>28% on the next $99,000 (This equals $190,150  - $91,150)</li>
      <li>33% on the next $223,200 (This equals  $413,350- $190,150)</li>
      <li>35% on the next $1,700 (This equals $415,050  - $413,350)</li>
      <li>39.6% on the balance</li>
      </ul>     
  <p><strong>Q:  What would the tax be for an individual with  $7,000 of taxable income?</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style:none;"><li>A:  $7,000 x .10 = <strong>$700</strong></li></ul>
  <p><strong>Q:  What would the tax be for an individual with  $12,000 of taxable income?</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style:none;"><li>A:  The first $9,275 would be taxed at 10%, with  the balance at 15%: <ul style="list-style:none;">
     <li>($9,275 x .10) + ($2,725 x .15) = <strong>$1,336.25</strong></li></ul></li></ul>
  <p><strong>Q.  What would the tax be for an individual with  $50,000 of taxable income?</strong></p>
     <ul style="list-style:none;"><li> A:  The first three tax rates would be utilized:<ul style="list-style:none"><li>($9,275 x .10) + ($28,375 x .15) + ($12,550 x .25) = <strong>$8,271.25</strong></li></ul></li></ul></div>
