  <p>Once adjusted gross income is determined, the next step is to subtract deductions and exemptions to derive taxable income. This is done on the back of Form 1040. </p>

  <p>As part of calculating taxable income, each taxpayer generally has the option on  line 40 of taking the standard deduction or itemizing deductions, using  whichever one is greater.  The size of the standard deduction will generally be determined by the taxpayer's <strong><em>filing status</em></strong>, but the amount is increased for those age 65 and over and for those who are blind. If the taxpayer chooses to itemize deductions, then the taxpayer will have to fill out and attach additional information. </p>
  <div class="example-box"> <h3>Filing Status</h3>
  	<p>An individual's filing status is determined on the last day of the tax year. The table below gives a brief description of each available filing status.</p>
