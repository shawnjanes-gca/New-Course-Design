  <h3>Basic Tax Formula</h3>
  <p>Before looking at Form 1040, let's first look at the basic tax formula that it represents.  This basic tax formula serves as a general map of the entire form.  It also serves as a roadmap for this course because we shall be discussing each segment of this formula throughout the remainder of this course.</p>
  <p>Take a few minutes to become thoroughly familiar with this formula, as it is your key to understanding the entire process.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each highlighted term to learn more.</span></p>
  <div class="example-box"><strong>Basic Tax Formula</strong>
  <p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic income tax formula begins with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gross Income&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Gross Income is based on Internal Revenue Code Section 61 and basically includes all income from any source, unless specifically excluded by the tax law.  This would include (among other things):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wages and other forms of compensation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest (excluding tax-exempt interest, e.g., interest from municipal bonds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alimony (but not child support)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business income (or losses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital gains (or losses) – subject to limitations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The taxable amount of distributions from IRAs, pensions, and annuities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rental income (or losses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farm income (or loss)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxable amount of Social Security benefits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Gross Income is the &lt;strong&gt;broadest measure of income.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Gross Income</a></p>
	<p style="margin-left:35px;">Less adjustments for Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)</p>
  <p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as its name suggests, is an individual’s income after certain adjustments are made to gross income.  Key adjustments for our purposes are deductions for contributing to an IRA and various self-employment deductions.  We will learn more about AGI later.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)</a></p>
	<p style="margin-left:35px;">Less the greater of:
   	<ol type="a">
        	<li><span>Standard deduction or</span></li>
            <li><span>Total itemized deductions</span></li>
    </ol>
	Less Personal and Dependency Exemption(s)</p>
	<p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taxable income&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is equal to AGI minus &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;standard or itemized deductions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;minus &lt;u&gt;personal and dependency exemptions.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every taxpayer is granted a standard tax deduction (think of it as an estimate of deductions that could be claimed by most people if they bothered to itemize), but some filers can increase total deductions by itemizing (listing) specific deductions to which they are entitled.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers are entitled to some minimum level of income for their own care that is exempt from taxation.  Furthermore, the amount exempt from taxation should be greater for taxpayers who also have dependents to support.  Thus, an exemption amount is deducted from income for most taxpayers (phased out for high income taxpayers) and the taxpayer’s dependents.&lt;/p&gt;
" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">Taxable Income</a></p>
	<p style="margin-left:35px;">Multiplied by personal tax rate</p>
	<p style="margin-left:35px;">Adjusted for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)</p>
	<p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tentative Tax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is determined by multiplying a person's  individual &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;tax rate &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(tax rates will be covered in greater detail later in this lesson) by their taxable income. Rates may vary based on types of  income.  Possible adjustments are then made to determine whether the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; should be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternative Minimum Tax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a separate income tax system that operates parallel to the regular income tax. Its purpose is to prevent the  wealthy from paying little or no income taxes. By targeting areas of tax preference in the regular income tax calculation, it helps assure that each taxpayer pays some minimal level of income tax.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">Tentative Tax</a></p>
	<p style="margin-left:35px;">Less tax credits</p>
	<p style="margin-left:35px;">Plus other taxes</p>
	<p><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tax liability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is equal to a person's  tentative tax minus any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;tax credits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Note, however, that other taxes may also be  due, such as self-employment tax or household employment taxes (see lines 58 to  62).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Tax credits&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are dollar-for-dollar reductions in the taxpayer's tax liability. Some of these credits provide tax breaks for low-income taxpayers, while others are available to taxpayers at all income levels.  There are two types of tax credits, refundable and non-refundable, which will be discussed in more detail later in this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">Equals Income Tax Liability</a></p>
