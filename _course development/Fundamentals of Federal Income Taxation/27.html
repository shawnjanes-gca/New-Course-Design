  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Calculation of Capital Gains Taxes</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Not all income is taxed at the marginal rates discussed previously. We have already pointed out that lower rates are applicable for qualified dividends. They are also available for long-term capital gains. We previously discussed the fact that capital gains and losses are netted for recognition on the front of Form 1040; we now address how taxes are assessed upon them. The tax on capital gains and losses is calculated at the following rates:</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  <ul>
  	<li>Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary rates.</li>
    <li>Long-term capital gain taxes are assessed at 20% (taxpayers in the highest tax bracket), 15% (taxpayers in the next four tax brackets), or 0% (taxpayers in the bottom two tax brackets).</li>
    <li>An additional 3.8% Medicare tax may apply to capital gains of taxpayers with Modified Adjusted Gross Income above certain levels.</li>
    <li>Excess capital losses are deductible against ordinary income up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married and filing separately); the balance is carried over until the next year.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  <p>This is quite simple if you are dealing with only one type of gain or loss, or if you only have losses and no gains, or gains and no losses. This is illustrated in the chart below:</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
  
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="30%" scope="col">If you have:</th>
        <th width="70%" scope="col">How you are taxed in 2016:</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Short-term gain only</td>
      <td>Taxed  at ordinary income tax rates. An additional 3.8% NIIT may apply.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short-term loss only</td>
      <td>You  can deduct up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married and filing separately) against other  income and carry over the balance to later years as a short-term loss.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Long-term gain only</td>
         <td>Long-term  gain is taxed at 0% if the person is in a 10% or 15% tax bracket, 20% if the  person is in the top tax bracket, and 15% for all other tax brackets. An additional  3.8% NIIT Medicare tax may apply.</td>
      
	</tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Long-term loss only</td>
        <td>You  can deduct up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married and filing separately) against other  income and carry over the balance to later years as a long-term loss.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>However, most investors will have a combination of short-term and long-term gains and losses, particularly if they are investing in the stock market. When that happens, gains and losses must be netted against each other in the following manner:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:25px;">Step 1:  Sort your realized gains and losses into long-term and short-term. 
Step 2: Net your short-term capital gains and losses. To do so, you subtract the purchase price (including commissions) from the sales proceeds (net of commission) for each security, and then total the results. This will leave you with a net short-term gain, a net short-term loss, or zero.
Step 3: Net your long-term capital gains and losses.  
Step 4:  Compute the tax impact according to the following table.
