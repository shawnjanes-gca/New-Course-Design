  <p>Once the Tentative Tax is identified, with or without an  adjustment for AMT, the final step is to reduce the Tentative Tax by any  available credits. A <strong><em>tax credit</em></strong> is a dollar-for-dollar  reduction in the taxpayer's tax liability.   To put tax credits in perspective, they are often spoken of in terms of  their deductible equivalent. For example, for an individual in the 33% tax bracket,  a $1 tax credit is equivalent to a $3 tax deduction. There are two types of tax  credits: refundable and non- refundable income.</p>

              <p>A  refundable tax credit is basically a guaranteed tax credit. Even if the  taxpayer's total tax liability is zero, refundable tax credits are still  applicable. Therefore, a taxpayer with a tax bill of $300 and refundable  credits totaling $500 will get a $200 refund. Examples of refundable tax  credits include Earned Income Tax Credit and Health Coverage Tax Credit.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the more common tax credits. Many of these will not apply to your typical client, as they only apply to low-income taxpayers. However, you should probably be familiar with all of them because you will see frequent mention of them in the news and you need to distinguish from among them those that are most likely relevant to your clients.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click each credit to learn more.</span>  </p>

 &lt;p&gt;You should be aware that there is also an &lt;strong&gt;adoption expense exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;, which is different than the credit. The adoption exclusion  allows taxpayers to exclude from taxable income amounts paid or reimbursed by  their employer for adoptions. The maximum exclusion amount equals the maximum  credit amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that a taxpayer may use both the adoption  credit and the exclusion.  However, any  expenses that are reimbursed by the employer will not be available for use in  computing the adoption expense credit.&lt;/p&gt;
