<p>There are two types of <strong><em>deductions</em></strong>, which are mutually exclusive. Basically, there are deductions "for AGI" and "from AGI."</p>
<p><strong>Deductions "for AGI"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deductions "for AGI" are deductions on the front of Form 1040 that are specifically allowed by law for deriving Adjusted Gross Income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final number on the front page of Form 1040 will be the taxpayer's Adjusted Gross Income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since AGI is the last line on the front of the tax return and all adjustments "for AGI" occur above that line, such adjustments are commonly referred to as "above-the-line" adjustments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deductions "from AGI"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deductions "from AGI" are expenses of a personal nature, specifically allowed to be used as a deduction on the back of Form 1040 (utilizing Schedule A, if itemizing deductions) after AGI has been computed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All deductions on the back of Form 1040 (utilizing Schedule A, if itemizing deductions) are deductions "from AGI."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since all deductions "from AGI" are on the back of the return, following the AGI line, they are frequently referred to as "below-the-line" adjustments.</p>
