<p>Special rules are associated with the recognition of losses on worthless securities.<strong><em> Worthless securities</em></strong> are stocks, stock rights, and bonds in a company that has gone completely out of business, which means the shares are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:void(0)"><strong>no longer trading</strong></a></span> and generally, no assets are available to pay the company's debts. Worthless securities are generally treated as a capital loss, but the date of worthlessness often places them in the category of a long-term capital loss, even if the investor held the security for less than a year before the company went out of business. This happens because <strong><em>the capital loss on a worthless security is not recognized until the last day of the calendar year in which it became worthless.</em></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Example</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>Dave purchases 100 shares of Widgets, Inc. at $25/share in October of the previous year&nbsp; Widgets, Inc. goes out of business on February 1 of the current year. How will Dave report his loss in the following circumstances?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dave sold the stock on January 31 of the previous year.</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If Dave sold the stock on January 31, he would have held the stock for less than a year and would report a short-term capital loss in the previous year</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Dave was still holding the stock when the company went out of business.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If Dave were still holding the stock in February, he would have a worthless stock, for which the worthlessness would have been deemed to occur on December 31 of the current year. Dave would report a long-term capital loss in the current year.</p>

<p>If XYZ Corp is trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but after filing for bankruptcy begins trading on the bulletin board for pennies per share, it is not a worthless stock. The stock must actually be worthless - not redeemable for any amount of money.</p>
