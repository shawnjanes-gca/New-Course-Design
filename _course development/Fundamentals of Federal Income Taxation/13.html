  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Worthless Securities</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Special rules are associated with the recognition of losses  on worthless securities.<strong><em>   Worthless securities</em></strong> are stocks, stock rights, and bonds in a  company that has gone completely out of business, which means the shares are <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;If XYZ Corp is trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but after filing for bankruptcy begins trading on the bulletin board for pennies per share, it is not a worthless stock.  The stock must actually be worthless – not redeemable for any amount of money&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">no longer trading</a> and  generally, no assets are available to pay the company's debts.  Worthless securities are generally treated as  a capital loss, but the date of worthlessness often places them in the category  of a long-term capital loss, even if the investor held the security for less  than a year before the company went out of business.  This happens because <strong>the capital loss on a worthless security is not recognized until the  last day of the calendar year in which it became worthless.</strong></p>

<div class="explanation-widget-box">
<h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Dave purchases 100 shares of Widgets, Inc. at $25/share in  October of the previous year  Widgets, Inc.  goes out of business on February 1 of the current year. How will Dave report  his loss in the following circumstances?</p>
  <ol style="width:95%;">
    <li><strong>Dave  sold the stock on January 31 of the previous year.</strong>
  
  <p>If Dave sold the stock on January  31, he would have held the stock for less than a year and would report a  short-term capital loss in the previous year</p></li>
  
    <li><strong>Dave  was still holding the stock when the company went out of business.</strong>
 
  <p>If Dave were still holding  the stock in February, he would have a worthless stock, for which the  worthlessness would have been deemed to occur on December 31 of the current  year. Dave would report a long-term capital loss in the current year.</p></li> </ol>
