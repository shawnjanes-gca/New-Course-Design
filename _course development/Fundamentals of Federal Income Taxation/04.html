  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Tax Credit versus Tax Deduction</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Additionally, you need to be able to distinguish between tax credits and tax deductions.  Remembering the basic tax formula, recognize that <em><strong>tax credits</strong></em> are subtracted after calculating the tentative tax, which means they are subtracted after the individual's tax rate has been applied.  Keeping this in mind, you should recognize that tax credits are dollar-for-dollar reductions in the individual's total tax liability.</p>
  <p>On the other hand,<em><strong> tax deductions</strong></em> are applied before arriving at the individual's taxable income.  This means they are applied before applying the individual's tax rate.  Therefore, tax deductions are not dollar-for-dollar reductions in an individual's tax liability.  So, tax credits are <strong>NOT</strong> equivalent to tax deductions.</p>

  <h3>Calculating Deductible Equivalents of Tax Credits</h3>
	<p>Calculating the deductible equivalent of a tax credit is a simple, but important calculation.  Use the following formula:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:35px;"><strong>Tax Credit รท Marginal Tax Rate = Deduction Equivalent</strong></p>

  <div class="explanation-widget-box"><h3>Examples</h3>
  	<ol style="width:95%">
    	<li><span>For an individual in the 33% tax bracket, what size deduction would be the equivalent of a $100 tax credit?
			<p style="margin-left:25px;">$100/.33 = $303.03</p>
			<p style="margin-left:25px;">A tax deduction of $303.03 would give an individual in the 33% tax bracket the same tax savings as a $100 tax credit.</p></span></li>
        <li><span>If a client in the 28% tax bracket were given the option of taking a $100 tax credit or a $300 tax deduction, which would you suggest?
			<p style="margin-left:25px;">$100/.28 = $357.14</p>
            <p style="margin-left:25px;">In this case, the client should take the tax credit because it results in a deduction equivalent that is greater than the $300 deduction.</p></span></li>
