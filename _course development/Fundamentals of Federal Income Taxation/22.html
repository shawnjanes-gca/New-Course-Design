<p>Itemized deductions are incurred expenses that are deducted from an individual&rsquo;s adjusted gross income.

<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Taxpayers are given deductions for certain taxes that they have paid or will pay in the year for which they are filing their tax return. These taxes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>State and Local Income Taxes (available for 2014 returns, expired for 2015 returns)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real Estate Taxes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal Property Taxes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2004, individuals have had the option of deducting general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes on Schedule A. This option expired December 31, 2012, was extended to the end of 2013, and expired again on December 31, 2013. The option was extended once again in late 2014 for 2014 returns. Be alert for potential extension of this option yet again for 2015 income tax returns.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The primary types of interest that are deductible are <strong><em>home mortgage interest</em></strong> and <strong><em>investment interest</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The total value of the mortgage may limit the amount of interest that is deductible. For example, in the acquisition of a home, interest on the total mortgage amount up to <strong>$1 million</strong> is deductible. This dollar limit applies to the combined mortgages on both the primary and secondary home.</p>
<p>Interest on home equity debt is also deductible, subject to limitation. Home equity debt is a mortgage taken out after October 13, 1987, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does not qualify as home acquisition debt or as grandfathered debt, and</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is secured by your qualified home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The deductible interest is limited to that generated by debt on the lesser of $100,000 or the total FMV of the home minus any home acquisition or grandfathered debt. For example, if the FMV of the home is $300,000 and the acquisition mortgage is $270,000, only interest on a home equity debt of $30,000 ($300,000 - $270,000) would be deductible.</p>
<p><strong><em> Investment interest</em></strong> is any interest on debt incurred to purchase property held for investment purposes. Interest on debt incurred to purchase property held for taxable investment purposes is generally deductible. However, you cannot deduct interest expenses that were incurred to purchase or carry tax-exempt investments. Furthermore, investment interest generally may only be deducted up to the extent of net investment income. <span class="style2"><strong>Click <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','hide','Layer2','','hide','Layer3','','show','Layer4','','hide','Layer5','','hide')" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;">here</a></span> for an example.</strong></span></p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The IRS identifies gifts to certain types of charities as qualified to be deducted from AGI. If the gift is to a qualified charity, a deduction can be taken equal to the asset's market value at the time of the gift (although the taxpayer may encounter limits on the amount that can be deducted, based upon the taxpayer's AGI, the nature of the property given, and the type of charity involved).</p>
<p>Since the deduction is based on current market value at the time of the gift, it is preferable to gift long-term appreciated property. When gifting certain long-term appreciated property (such as stocks and bonds), no capital gain is realized upon the gift, yet a full deduction is made for its current market value, <strong><em>subject to a 30% of AGI limitation rule.</em></strong> Subsequently, the charity can sell the asset and pay no capital gain taxes due to its tax-exempt status. If the appreciated property has not been held long-term at the time of making the gift, there is still no recognition of gain when making the gift but the deduction will be limited to the basis in the asset.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>For individuals who endure casualty or theft loss, tax deductions are available. <strong><em>Casualty loss</em></strong> is defined as a sudden, unusual, and unexpected loss. <strong>Theft </strong>is the act of taking something from someone unlawfully. There are several rules generally applied to deducting a loss from casualty or theft.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_6">
<div id="p7ABc1_6" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>There are certain deductions labeled as "miscellaneous" that may be claimed as itemized deductions. For the most common of these deductions, the taxpayer must reduce the total by 2% of their adjusted gross income. These include unreimbursed employee expenses, investment advisory and custodial fees and certain investment expenses, tax preparation fees, union dues, safe deposit fees, certain license and regulatory fees, and others.</p>
<p>Others are not subject to this reduction. These include gambling losses up to the amount of gambling winnings, amortizable premium on taxable bonds, loss from other activities from a K-1, repayments of more than $3,000 under a claim of right, federal estate tax on income in respect of a decedent, impairment-related work expenses of persons with disabilities, and certain casualty and theft losses from income-producing property.</p>

The patient, whose closest pool was 30 miles away, then constructed an indoor pool at a cost of $50,000, which increased the value of the home by $30,000. In this scenario, there are two questions to answer.</p>
<p>1. Is the pool a deductible expense?</p>

<p>2. How much could the patient deduct?</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>A single taxpayer has adjusted gross income of $458,250 in 2015. The taxpayer has $40,000 in itemized deductions before application of the phase-out rules. The excess adjusted gross income is $200,000 - calculated as $458,250 less $258,250. The taxpayer must reduce his or her itemized deductions by $6,000 - calculated as 3% of $200,000. The taxpayer may deduct only $34,000 as an itemized deduction.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Assume the taxpayer in Example 1 has an adjusted gross income of $1,758,250.&nbsp; The excess adjusted gross income is $1,500,000 calculated as $1,758,250 less $258,250. 3% of $1,500,000 is $45,000.&nbsp; In this case, the taxpayer would appear to lose all of his or her itemized deductions; however, the maximum reduction under these phase-out rules is 80% of the itemized deductions.&nbsp; Therefore, the taxpayer would deduct $8,000 as an itemized deduction. The $8,000 is calculated as follows: $40,000 times 80% maximum percent reduction equals $32,000 maximum dollar reduction - $40,000 less $32,000 equals $8,000.</p>
