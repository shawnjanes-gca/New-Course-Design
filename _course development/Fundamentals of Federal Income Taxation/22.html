  <p>Itemized deductions are incurred expenses that are deducted from an individual's adjusted gross income. A taxpayer's itemized deductions may be limited by the <strong>itemized deduction phase-out rules</strong>.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  <h3>Itemized deduction phase-out</h3>
<p>There was no phase-out of itemized deductions in tax years 2009 through 2012. However, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 marked a return of itemized deduction phase-outs for taxpayers with adjusted gross income above certain limits.</p>
<p>A taxpayer's itemized deductions are reduced when adjusted gross income in 2016 (as indexed) exceeds certain limits. A taxpayer must reduce his or her itemized deductions by 3% of the excess over the limits in the chart below. No more than 80% of a taxpayer's itemized deductions may be lost under these rules.</p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
	<p>A single taxpayer has adjusted gross income of $459,400 in 2016. The taxpayer has $40,000 in itemized deductions before application of the phase-out rules. The excess adjusted gross income is $200,000 - calculated as $458,250 less $259,400. The taxpayer must reduce his or her itemized deductions by $6,000 - calculated as 3% of $200,000. The taxpayer may deduct only $34,000 as an itemized deduction.</p>
	<h3>Example 2</h3>
	<p>Assume the taxpayer in Example 1 has an adjusted gross income of $1,759,400.  The excess adjusted gross income is $1,500,000 calculated as $1,759,400 less $259,400. Then, 3% of $1,500,000 is $45,000. In this case, the taxpayer would appear to lose all of his or her itemized deductions; however, the maximum reduction under these phase-out rules is 80% of the itemized deductions. Therefore, the taxpayer would deduct $8,000 as an itemized deduction. The $8,000 is calculated as follows: $40,000 times 80% maximum percent reduction equals $32,000 maximum dollar reduction. Hence, the deduction allowed is $8,000 calculated as $40,000 less $32,000.</p>

              <p>Deductible unreimbursed medical expenses are subject to a floor of 10% of AGI (2016). This means that for a taxpayer with an AGI of $100,000, only medical expenses in excess of $10,000 (10% of AGI) would be deductible.</p>

&lt;p&gt; For example, presume a doctor prescribed for a patient,  after suffering a heart attack, to swim one mile every day. The patient, whose  closest pool was 30 miles away, then constructed an indoor pool at a cost of  $50,000, which increased the value of the home by $30,000. In this scenario,  there are two questions to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the pool a  deductible expense?&lt;/strong&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The answer would be  yes. The pool is medically necessary and the closest one is 30 miles away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much could the  patient deduct?&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patient would be able to deduct $20,000 (subject to the 10% floor).  While the patient spent $50,000, the pool increased the value of the home by  $30,000. Therefore, the patient is only out the additional $20,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

              <p>The primary types of interest that are deductible are <strong><em>home mortgage  interest</em></strong> and <strong><em>investment interest</em></strong>.</p>
			<p>The total value of the mortgage may limit the amount of interest that is deductible. For example, in the acquisition of a home,  interest on the total mortgage amount up to <strong>$1 million</strong> is deductible. This dollar limit applies to the combined mortgages on both the primary and secondary home.</p>
			<p>Interest on home equity debt is also deductible, subject to  limitation. Home equity debt is a mortgage taken out after October 13, 1987, that:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Does not qualify as home acquisition debt or as grandfathered debt, and</li>
				<li>Is secured by your qualified home.</li>
			</ul>
            <p>The deductible interest is limited to that generated by debt on the lesser of $100,000 or the total FMV of the home minus any home acquisition or grandfathered debt. For example, if the FMV of the home is $300,000 and the acquisition mortgage is $270,000, only interest on a home equity debt of $30,000 ($300,000 - $270,000) would be deductible.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Investment interest</em></strong> is any interest on debt incurred to purchase property  held for investment purposes. Interest on debt incurred to purchase property  held for taxable investment purposes is generally deductible. However, you  cannot deduct interest expenses that were incurred to purchase or carry  tax-exempt investments. For example, interest paid on debt used to purchase  municipal bonds would generally be non-deductible because the municipal bond  interest is generally excluded from income. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, investment interest generally may only be deducted up to the extent of net investment income.  <span class="pageInstruction">Click <a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_2" class="p7TTM_trg" title="<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Bill takes out a loan to purchase property (his only investment).  If he receives $500 in income from that property, he may not deduct any more than $500 in interest expenses in that year.

              <p>The IRS identifies gifts to certain types of charities as  qualified to be deducted from AGI. If the gift is to a qualified charity, a  deduction can be taken equal to the asset's market value at the time of the  gift (although the taxpayer may encounter limits on the amount that can be  deducted, based upon the taxpayer's AGI, the nature of the property given, and  the type of charity involved).</p>
              <p>Since  the deduction is based on current market value at the time of the gift, it is  preferable to gift long-term appreciated property.  When gifting certain long-term appreciated  property (such as stocks and bonds), no capital gain is realized upon the gift,  yet a full deduction is made for its current market value, <strong><em>subject to a 30% of AGI  limitation rule.</em></strong> Subsequently, the charity can sell the asset and pay  no capital gain taxes due to its tax-exempt status. If the appreciated property  has not been held long-term at the time of making the gift, there is still no recognition of gain when making the gift but the deduction will be limited to  the basis in the asset. <span class="pageInstruction">Click <a href="#"  id="p7Tooltip_3" class="p7TTM_trg" title="<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Fred gave 100 shares of XYZ stock he held long-term to the American Red Cross.  His basis in the shares was $1,200 and the current market value at the time of the gift was $2,000.  Fred can claim a $2,000 deduction on his income tax return, subject to certain AGI limitations. If the stock had not been held long-term, Fred's deduction would be limited to his $1,200 basis in the stock.</p>
<p>While the American Red Cross will assume Fred's basis of $1,200, it can nonetheless sell the stocks for $2,000 and pay no taxes on the realized gain because of its tax-exempt status. </p>">here</a> for an example.</span></p>

For the most common of these deductions, the taxpayer must reduce the total by 2% of their adjusted gross income. These include unreimbursed employee expenses, investment advisory and custodial fees and certain investment expenses, tax preparation fees, union dues, safe deposit fees, certain license and regulatory fees, and others.</p>
