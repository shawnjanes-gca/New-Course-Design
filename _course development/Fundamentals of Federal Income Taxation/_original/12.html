<p>Being familiar with the process of netting capital gains and losses is a fairly important concept. This is especially true in the investment world, where the netting of capital gains and losses is often taken into consideration when making decisions to sell securities. This is particularly true as investors approach year-end:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an individual investor approaches year-end with realized net gains, this may present an opportunity to go ahead and sell some investments that have depreciated in value, thereby utilizing the unrealized losses to offset the realized gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some restrictions on strategies that can be utilized. In particular, you should be familiar with the <strong><em>wash sale rule</em></strong>. A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss and, within 30 days before or after the sale, the investor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acquires (by purchase or taxable exchange) substantially identical stock or securities, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquires a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When this occurs, part or all of the loss on the sale is disallowed and must be added to the cost of the new stock or securities. In this manner, the loss deduction is postponed until disposition of the new stock or securities. Furthermore, the holding period for the new purchase will include the holding period of the stock or securities sold.</p>

<h3><strong>Example</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>An investor purchases 100 shares of XYZ stock for $1,000. At a later date, the investor sells the shares for $700 and within 30 days repurchases 100 shares of XYZ stock for $800. Since this is a wash sale, the investor cannot deduct the $300 loss on the sale. The investor must add the $300 to the basis of his new purchase, bringing it to $1,100. As you can see, if he were to immediately sell his new purchase for $800, he would recognize the same $300 loss. Thus, this process effectively "washes" the first sale and defers to loss deduction into the future.</p>
