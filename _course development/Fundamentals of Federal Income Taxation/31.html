  <h1><span class="pagetitle">AMT Preference Items</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The primary thing you need to know about the AMT calculation  is that it does not use the same Taxable Income figure as was used in the  regular income tax calculation.  Rather,  it makes a series of adjustments to income for what are deemed <strong><em>tax  preference items</em></strong>.  These  adjustments, which are typically added back to income, will likely result in an <strong><em>AMT  Income (AMTI) </em></strong>that is higher than the one computed with the regular  income tax calculation. Since the tax calculation is different, the fact that  AMT Income may be higher than regular Taxable Income does not always result in  a higher tax, but the likelihood of a higher tax increases if the adjustments  are sizeable.</p>
<p>The first section of this Form 6251 is provided below. This is where adjustments are made for tax preference items to derive AMT Income, on which the alternative tax calculation will be made. Take a few minutes to read through the tax preference items in this section. We have highlighted the more common adjustments.</p>

&lt;p&gt;The AMT calculation begins with AGI from Form 1040 if the standard deduction was used.  If deductions were itemized on Schedule A, then the calculation begins with AGI minus the itemized deductions from Schedule A. The next few lines will make adjustments for some of those itemized deductions.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Note also that we are beginning with a number that has NOT been adjusted for personal exemptions; nor is there an adjustment for personal exemptions in deriving AMT income.  Thus, we have effectively adjusted for personal exemptions by beginning with the amount entered in line 1.&lt;/p&gt;" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="2,152,549,181" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line, and the next few that follow, adjust for some of the deductions that were allowed when we itemized deductions on Schedule A. &lt;/p&gt;" >

Remember that when deductions were itemized on Schedule A, we were allowed to deduct &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;state income taxes, real estate taxes, and property taxes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Here we must add them back.

&lt;p&gt;Certain interest on a home mortgage not used to buy, build, or improve your home (or a second home that is a qualified dwelling) must be added back. There may also be an adjustment if the home was refinanced.&lt;/p&gt;
" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="1,212,550,225" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5" title="Line 5
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;miscellaneous deductions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from Schedule A get added back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one place where the taxpayer gets to reduce AMT income, whereas all the other adjustments under discussion generally result in increasing AMT income. If the taxpayer received a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tax refund&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the prior year on state or local taxes that had to be added into the calculation of regular taxes, the refund gets subtracted as an adjustment for AMT income.&lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;Interest earned on municipal bonds is exempt from regular income taxes.  However, for AMT purposes, a distinction is made between those municipal bonds that are issued for pure governmental functions and those that are issued for “private activity” issuers such as airports and certain types of housing agencies. These “private activity” municipal bonds, if issued after August 7, 1986, are included in the calculation of AMT income - unless issued by a 501(c)(3) organization.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code identifies certain nonprofit organizations that are generally identified as existing for religious, charitable, or educational purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incentive stock options (ISO)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are options granted by an employer to employees that allow the employee to  purchase stock in the corporation. For normal income tax purposes, the exercise  of the option is not a taxable event; rather, taxation occurs when the stock is  finally sold. However, the failure to tax upon exercise of the option is  treated as a tax preference item for AMT purposes. Thus, the amount by which  the FMV exceeds the exercise price on the date of exercise will be added to the  AMT income in the year of exercise, provided the taxpayer's exercise rights are  not subjected to a substantial risk of forfeiture. &lt;/p&gt;" >

&lt;p&gt;If a taxpayer, for regular  tax purposes, depreciates real property using accelerated&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; depreciation methodologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,  then the depreciation may have to be recomputed using less aggressive  methodologies. This may be an issue for business owners.&lt;/p&gt;" >
