<p>Having introduced the concept of the unlimited marital deduction, it is important to introduce a recent change to federal law regarding the definition of a spouse.</p>
<p>In 1996, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was enacted, defining a &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; for purposes of &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; as a heterosexual union. DOMA barred same-gender couples from being recognized as &ldquo;spouses&rdquo; under federal law.</p>
<p>However, in June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that portions of DOMA were unconstitutional. Today, legally married same gender couples now enjoy the same federal income tax, gift tax, and estate tax benefits as heterosexual couples.</p>
<p>More changes will likely come over the next years in regards to same sex couples and estate planning. For now, individual states can decide the legality of same gender marriages, but if a same gender couple is married in a state that recognizes such marriages as legal, then federal tax laws will grant them the same benefits as heterosexual marriages.</p>
