  <p>Now that you have the context of wills and the probate process, it should be apparent that everyone needs a will.  Failure to have a will is to allow state laws to settle your estate for you, rather than you determining who receives your estate.  When one or more trusts are coupled with the will, the combination can actually give control that extends beyond the grave.  Such a plan makes it possible to provide directions that will govern the management and use of the funds long after death of the testator/grantor.</p>

      <h3>Open-ended Questions</h3>
      <p>When you encounter clients or prospects who have not done proper planning or do not review their plans periodically to ensure they are appropriate, ask them an open-ended question that leads them to face the consequences of inaction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>What process have you used to construct an effective estate plan that serves your needs and goals?</span></li>
        <li><span>How have you made sure your estate plan remains current with your present needs and goals?</span></li>
        <li><span>How have you made plans to name guardians for your minor children if you and your spouse die in a common accident?</span></li>
        <li><span>How have you planned your estate to make sure your assets continue to accomplish your goals after your death?</span></li>
      </ul>
