    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Many reasons are often given to stress the importance of helping clients address their estate planning needs.  For example:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Clients tend to      procrastinate planning their estates and need someone to motivate them.</li>
    <li>Clients lack the necessary      technical expertise to recognize they have a planning need.</li>
    <li>Or, it is an excellent way      to identify assets that you are not currently managing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of these points are true. However, the primary reason you should address estate planning needs with your clients is because it moves you beyond merely addressing the management of the client's assets to addressing the ultimate goals, dreams, and fears associated with those assets.<br>
    The fact is that no other financial conversation you can have with a client takes place at such a deeply emotional level.  It is a conversation that allows you to gain insight into what is of ultimate importance to the client.<br>
    This results in the client making a significant emotional commitment to your relationship. Having made that commitment, the client is reluctant to do so elsewhere, particularly when you have done a good job of helping the client address these emotionally-charged issues. This moves the client beyond merely being a "satisfied" client to becoming a "loyal client."  Creating loyal clients has two payoffs for you:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>First, it extends the      duration of the relationship.</li>
    <li>Second, it increases the      assets clients bring to you.  In      fact, one recent study, which defined loyal clients as those who had made      an emotional commitment to the relationship, found that 90% of loyal      clients will contribute new assets every year <em><strong>without</strong></em> being asked      to do so.</li>
  </ul>
