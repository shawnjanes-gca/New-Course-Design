  <p>Top producers are always looking for an idea that can help them distinguish themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace.&nbsp; One of the most powerful ways to differentiate yourself is by broadening your ability to provide more comprehensive financial advice.&nbsp; The ability to address estate planning issues for clients will give you an edge over the countless others trying to survive by applying a one-dimensional approach.&nbsp; Those who continue to focus on a limited array of solutions will fail to capitalize on significant opportunities to grow their business and will become increasingly vulnerable.</p>
  <p> The benefits of being able to address your clients' estate planning needs are significant.&nbsp; Specifically, integrating estate planning into your approach will enable you to expand your reach while increasing production and client retention.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Expand Reach -</strong> Expand      your current client relationships by:</li>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>Forming trust       relationships with your clients provides an opportunity to develop       relationships with their heirs, increasing the continuity of the       relationship through an unprecedented era of inter-generational transfers       of wealth that will occur from baby-boomers to their heirs.</li>
      <li>Providing more       comprehensive and timely financial advice for your clients.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Increase Production -</strong> By addressing estate planning issues,      you will be equipped with additional resources to:</li>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>Target a higher net worth       clientele</li>
      <li>Uncover and capture       additional assets with existing clients</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Increase Retention -</strong> Studies show that most affluent clients      prefer to work with a single advisor.       Those advisors who are unable to address a comprehensive array of      their needs will eventually lose relationships to those who can.      Additionally, statistics show that relationships that include a trust have      an average lifespan of more than 13 years – over twice that of non-trust      related relationships. </li></ul></div>
