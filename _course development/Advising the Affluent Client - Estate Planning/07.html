  <p>Trust agreements are extraordinarily flexible, and can be tailored for virtually any purpose.  They may be <strong>revocable,</strong> meaning the person who created the trust can alter or cancel it at any time.  Or they may be <strong>irrevocable,</strong> meaning they cannot be altered or canceled after their creation.  </p>
  <p>  They may be created during life, which is known as a <strong><em>living trust,</em></strong> or by a person's will, which is known as a <strong><em>testamentary trust.  </em></strong> Since the person who created the will is dead when a testamentary trust is funded, it is by its very nature irrevocable.</p>
  <p> They may bind the trustee to do only what the <span id="p7Tooltip_1" class="p7TTM_trg" title="The trustee is the person or institution that administers the trust per the terms of the trust document."><a href="#">trustee</a></span> is explicitly directed to do by the grantor or the terms of the trust, which is called a <strong><em>non-discretionary trust.  </em></strong>Or they may allow the trustee to use his or her own discretion in deciding what investment changes to make and/or how to distribute income or principal to the beneficiaries, which is known as a <strong><em>discretionary trust.</em></strong></p>
