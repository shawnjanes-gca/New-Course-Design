<p>While the Diamonds could certainly reduce their taxable exposure by making distributions to charities upon their deaths, let's turn our attention to actions that could be taken during life. These strategies are designed to reduce the size of the taxable estate while alive, thereby reducing or eliminating the remaining potential estate tax liability. In particular, we will discuss four commonly considered lifetime strategies for reducing the size of one's taxable estate. These applications are just as relevant today for large, taxable estates as they were in 2009.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Since Mr. and Mrs. Diamond planned to ultimately leave everything to their children, why not make transfers during their lifetimes? While there is always some risk of later needing assets that are given away, this risk is mitigated somewhat by the size of their estate. It is also minimized in good family situations where there is some assurance that children are willing to see to the care of their parent(s).</p>
<p>They could each make annual exclusion gifts to each child without generating a gift tax liability. Since all the children are married, they could do the same for each child's spouse. Thus, in a single year, they could make 16 annual exclusion gifts (2 for each child and each child's spouse). What's more, they could repeat this in the following years, so long as needed to reduce their estate tax exposure.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In addition to, or in lieu of, annual exclusion gifts, the Diamonds could also have elected to make direct payment of medical expenses and tuition for their children and grandchildren. In this manner, they could help their children and grandchildren while alive without suffering any gift tax liability. This might be particularly appealing if their handicapped son has medical expenses that exceed what they could give him through annual exclusion gifts.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Create an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>When you own life insurance on your own life, the full face value of the policy is included in your estate when you die. This is true even when the policy itself has no current cash value. In 2009, George owned a $500,000 life insurance policy. Simply by transferring that policy into an irrevocable trust, which becomes the new owner of the policy, he could remove $500,000 from his taxable estate. However, to prevent making such transfers from their death bed, the IRS requires that George must live for three years after the transfer. If he does not live that long, the insurance proceeds are includable in his estate.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> - If a new policy is being purchased, the three-year rule will not apply if the policy is issued to the trust rather than being transferred from an owner to the trust. Thus, if George is still insurable, it might be preferable to have the trust apply for and purchase a new policy.</p>

<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>A charitable remainder trust is an irrevocable trust for a qualified charity and is not subject to transfer taxes. In such an arrangement, the grantor retains an income interest in the trust, while naming a charity to receive the remainder of the trust upon termination. The income interest is stated as a percentage (at least 5% but no more than 50%) of the market value of the trust. This can be calculated and fixed at the start of the trust, or can be recalculated annually, in which case it will vary with changes to the market value of the underlying assets.</p>
<p>If the Diamonds have any significant charitable intent, then this might be a consideration. Of course, they could also wait until death to make the charitable bequest, thereby receiving a charitable deduction on their estate tax return. However, by making the transfer in their lifetime they could:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remove the contributed assets from their taxable estates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversify some of their low income-producing assets, while deferring capital gains. No capital gains are realized when the assets are contributed to the trust; nor does the grantor recognize any capital gains when the assets are sold in the trust. The trust inherits the grantor's cost basis. As sales occur and capital gains are realized, they are accumulated and distributed to the grantor only if ordinary income is insufficient to make the required percentage payout. Only as it is paid out to the beneficiary will there be a capital gains impact to the beneficiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defer and sometimes avoid capital gains taxes on the appreciation of contributed assets. The grantor receives capital gain income only when and if it becomes necessary for the trust to distribute accumulated capital gain income to cover the annual percentage payout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase their income while alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive a charitable deduction on their income tax return. The deduction would be equal to the present value of the remainder interest passing to the charity, as determined at the time of funding the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the satisfaction of helping a charity while they are alive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
