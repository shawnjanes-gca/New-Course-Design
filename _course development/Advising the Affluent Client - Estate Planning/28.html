    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The amount of assets that are protected from taxation by the Applicable Credit Amount is known as the <strong><em>Applicable Exclusion Amount</em></strong>.  Stated another way, the Applicable Exclusion Amount is that amount of taxable transferred assets that will result in a tax bill equivalent to the Applicable Credit Amount, resulting in zero taxes owed to the IRS.</p>
  <p> In Recent years, the Applicable Credit Amount and corresponding Applicable Exclusion Amount available to U.S. citizens and resident aliens have grown considerably. For example, in the decade between 2001 and 2011, we saw the following change:</p>

  </table>
<p>In just 10 years, we went from being able to make $675,000 of taxable transfers to making $5,000,000 of taxable transfers without having to pay a single dollar of Federal Gift and Estate Taxes. This led to a dramatic decrease in the number of estates that owed gift and estate taxes, and an equally dramatic lowering of concern by most Americans regarding depletion of their estates by estate taxes.</p>
  <p> For years following 2011, the growth of the Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amounts has slowed. This is because legislation fixed the Applicable Credit and Exclusion Amounts to 2011 levels, but began adjusting the amount for inflation. Today, their inflation-adjusted values are:</p>

  <p>While you need not memorize the Applicable Credit Amount, you should commit the Applicable Exclusion Amount to memory. Knowing this amount will be extremely useful in evaluating the tax exposure of any given estate.</p>

  <h3>Illustration</h3>
  <p>In 2012, James made a $1,000,000 taxable gift to his children. He had made no prior taxable gifts and had no transfer tax credits other than his own Applicable Credit Amount. 
Next, in 2014, he made another $1,000,000 taxable gift to his children. 
Finally, he died in 2016 with a taxable estate valued at $10,000,000. How much of his estate was NOT protected by his Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount?

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        James filed a gift tax for the 2012 gift, calculating a tax of $345,800. But his Applicable Credit Amount was more than enough to cover the tax, so no tax was due to the IRS.</p>
      <p> When he filed the gift tax return for the 2014 gift, he <strong><em>added together the 2012 and 2014 gifts</em></strong> (remember, all post-1976 taxable gifts must be added back for both gift tax returns and estate tax returns). Thus, he reported his cumulative lifetime taxable transfers of $2,000,000, with a calculated tax of $745,800. Again, no tax was due because his Applicable Credit Amount was more than enough to cover the tax.</p>
Upon his death, the executor added all post-1976 taxable gifts ($2,000,000) to the value of his estate ($10,000), and calculated the tax on the combined $12,000. The 2016 Applicable Credit of $2,225,800 was sufficient to protect the first $5,450,000 (in this case, the $2,000,000 of lifetime taxable gifts and $3,450,000 of his estate at death). Tax would be due, however, on the remaining $6,550,000 of his estate. Since this will be taxed at the marginal rate of 40%, James' executor will pay the IRS: $6,550, 000 x 40% = $2,620,000.</div>

<h3>What about Nonresident Aliens?</h3>
  <p>Unlike U.S. citizens and resident aliens, who have a generous unified Applicable Exclusion Amount for use with both lifetime gifts and estate transfers, <a href="#" title="All non-citizens who do not meet the test for being a resident alien are classified as nonresident aliens, even though they may be living in the United States for an extended period of time. They are subject to Federal Gift and Estate Tax only on their &lt;strong&gt;U.S. “situs” assets&lt;/strong&gt;. Unless modified by treaty, this generally includes real and tangible personal property located in the U.S., business assets located in the U.S., and stocks." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">nonresident aliens</a> have an Applicable Exclusion Amount that can only be used for at-death transfer of their estates. Furthermore, the estate-only Applicable Exclusion Amount for nonresident aliens is limited to <strong>$60,000</strong>. This amount is <strong>NOT adjusted for inflation</strong>. </p>
