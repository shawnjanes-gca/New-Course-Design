  <p>The key to being a successful advisor is not so much about the ability to give advice as it is about the ability to ask questions.  In fact, <em><strong>the hallmark of a great advisor is asking the right questions at the right time</strong></em>.</p>
  <p> Not all questions are the same.  Some questions are for gathering information.  These are generally referred to as <em><strong>profiling questions</strong></em>.  This is where you begin.  By asking a series of fact-finding questions, it becomes possible for an advisor to identify potential needs and establish the framework for applying his or her skill in formulating potential solutions.</p>
  <p> Once a client's need is uncovered through profiling, that need must then be turned into a sales opportunity.  All too often, advisors attempt to accomplish this by diagnosing a need and immediately telling the prospect how to solve it.  In other words, they make the mistake of trying to sell the facts, on the assumption that the mere offering of their diagnosis and solution will be sufficient to motivate the client to action.  This seldom works because: <em><strong>individuals typically buy what they want, not necessarily what they need</strong></em>. </p>

              <p>If the decision of which car to purchase was influenced solely by facts, we would all simply input our specifications into a worksheet and - voila - the most appropriate make and model for you would appear.  But we all know the process is much different.  In fact, many decide what car they want based upon issues such as appeal of the style, how they feel sitting behind the wheel, or how they feel the car reflects their own personality or sense of status.  Then, after deciding what they want, they mentally justify their decision with facts such as &quot;it's a good value&quot; or &quot;it scored well in Consumer Reports.&quot;</p>

<p>To get the client or prospect to <em><strong>want</strong></em> the solution, the advisor must first engender an emotional response that leads people to be unwilling to accept their current situation.  This is because: <em><strong>people typically buy on emotion, and justify with facts</strong></em>.</p>
<p> Don't misunderstand this.  We're not suggesting that advisors should manipulate emotions.  However, we ARE saying that advisors will not bridge the gap between a need and a want until the client or prospect experiences the need on an emotional level. Individuals will not truly want a solution with any degree of urgency until they become concerned and discomforted by the presence of their need.</p>
<p> The best path to engendering this emotional response is by asking another type of question, which we call <em><strong>awareness questions</strong></em>. Such questions help clients become aware of their needs AND, having raised their awareness, foster a sense of urgency within the client to address the need.</p>

            <p>Good awareness questions create a sense of urgency that can never be achieved by simply telling a client of a need. To illustrate, consider the following scenario:</p>
            <p>You are walking down the street and see that a piano is about to fall on a bystander. If you tell the person, &quot;You need to move,&quot; the person is not going to be very motivated to do so because he or she has no idea WHY there is a need to move. However, if instead you say, &quot;How are you going to avoid being crushed by that piano dangling over your head?&quot; you probably should step to the side because the person will be quite motivated to move!          </p>

            <p>Questions that begin with the word &quot;How&quot; are, by their nature, process-oriented. They make the client think through the process of resolving the situation you propose. (Note: This does not mean that every awareness question must begin with &quot;How,&quot; but this is a good general rule of thumb, especially as you begin building expertise in asking these types of questions.) For example: </p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>&quot;How have you made      the determination that you would prefer to pay more taxes at death than      reduce them through lifetime gifts?&quot;</li>
              <li>&quot;How have you made the determination that this is the best strategy for saving for college expenses?&quot;</li></ul></div>

            <p>Be careful to avoid embarrassing or confronting your clients when asking a question. One way to do this is by asking your question in a manner that presumes they have good reasons for the decisions they have made. When they don't have a good reason, they will generally have no problem responding with, &quot;Well, I really hadn't thought about that&quot; and they will not feel demeaned by having you point out their failings to them. <br>
For example, don't ask: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> &quot;Why did you buy taxable bonds when you could clearly have increased your after-tax income by purchasing municipals?&quot;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Instead, ask the question in this manner: <br>
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>              &quot;How have you structured your bond portfolio to optimize your after-tax return?&quot; </li>
            </ul>
The first question is confrontational. While the second question may surface the fact that the client or the client's current advisor did NOT take after-tax return into consideration, it is clearly non-confrontational and more likely to solicit an inquiry as to what you might suggest.          </div>

            <p>If a person is currently working with another advisor, frame the question to focus on the advisor instead of on the individual.

It will also position the client to be curious as to how your approach might be different.</p>

            <p>There is an old adage that an attorney should never ask a question of someone on the witness stand without first knowing the answer. This is also true for financial advisors. Whenever you ask an awareness question, be prepared for the client to ask how you would answer the question you just asked. For example, if you ask &quot;How has your advisor structured your portfolio to meet your objectives,&quot; be prepared to explain how you would go about structuring the portfolio. In short, be prepared to present your solutions once the client is ready to hear it.</p>
