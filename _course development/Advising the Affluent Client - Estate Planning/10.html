    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>In working with a client or prospect, any number of factors may lead you to identify that protection is a relevant need.  For example, the person may be elderly and in poor health, with no nearby relatives; the person may reveal concern regarding a special needs child; or the person may have minor children.  Once you identify that a need for protection may exist, it is not sufficient that <em>you</em> see it; you must help your <em>client</em> see the need.  Until the client sees the need and feels some sense of urgency to resolve the need, no action will be made.</p>
  <p> The best way to help the client identify the need and feel motivated to action is to ask open-ended questions that deal with the repercussions of failing to adequately plan for the need.  For example, to help your clients/prospects see a need to plan to provide greater protection for themselves and their loved ones, you might ask them the following questions.</p>
