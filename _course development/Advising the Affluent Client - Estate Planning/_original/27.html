<h2>The Applicable Credit Amount</h2>

<p>In addition to the deductions and exclusions we have discussed to this point, there is also a sizeable tax credit. Every U.S. citizen and <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>resident alien (non-citizen resident)</strong></a> has a lifetime <strong><em>credit</em></strong> against gift and estate taxes; it is typically referred to as the &ldquo;<strong><em>Applicable Credit Amount</em></strong>.&rdquo; A &ldquo;credit&rdquo; is an amount that you get to <strong><em>subtract after a tax is calculated</em></strong>. So, once we calculate a tentative transfer tax, we get to subtract the credit from the calculated tax.</p>
<p>The Applicable Credit Amount is &ldquo;<strong><em>unified</em></strong>,&rdquo; meaning it is shared with lifetime transfers (i.e., gifts) and estate transfers (i.e., at death); for this reason, you will sometimes see the Applicable Credit Amount referred to as the &ldquo;<strong><em>Unified Credit</em></strong>.&rdquo; Thus, the credit can be used to offset calculated gift or estate taxes; but if it is all used up by lifetime taxable gifts, there will be no credit left to protect further assets that transfer at death.</p>
<p>Historically, the Applicable Credit Amount has not always been fully unified between gift and estate taxes. In other words, there have been times in the past when only a portion of the Applicable Credit Amount could be used for lifetime taxable gifts; but today, there is no limit on how much of the credit can be used while alive.</p>

<h4>Resident Alien (Non-Citizen Resident)</h4>
<p>For transfer tax purposes, a non-citizen person is considered a resident alien and domiciled in the United States if the person lives in the United States with no present intention of leaving the United States. Various factors, such as statements of intent, length of time in the U.S., visa status, etc.) are used to determine domicile. Resident aliens are generally under the same gift and estate tax rules as U.S. citizens and are subject to taxation on their <strong><em>entire estates wherever situated</em></strong>.</p>
