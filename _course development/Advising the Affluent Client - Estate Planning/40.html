<p>The American Tax Relief Act of 2012 (2012 Tax Relief Act) removed the uncertainty regarding gift and estate taxes by essentially doing two things:</p>

<li>
<p>It raised the maximum transfer tax rate for 2013 and beyond from 35% to 40%.</p>

<p>As you can see, the 2010 and 2012 Tax Relief Acts were merely revisions of the rules that were formerly in place. While the increase in the Applicable Exclusion Amount and the ability to apply the full Exclusion Amount to lifetime gifts are quite significant, perhaps the most dramatic change is the portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount between spouses. This has a very significant impact upon the estate planning techniques of recent years. <em><strong>No longer is it necessary for a married couple to create a Credit Shelter Trust to make sure both Applicable Exclusion Amounts get used. Under the new rules, a spouse can leave everything to the surviving spouse and the surviving spouse can have the combined Applicable Exclusion Amounts for use in his/her estate for Federal gift and estate tax purposes.</strong></em></p>
