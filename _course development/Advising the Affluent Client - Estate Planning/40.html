  <p>As you have seen, the sizeable Applicable Exclusion Amount, coupled with deductions and exclusions, means that most affluent clients do not have to worry today about paying a federal estate tax. But it has only been in recent years that the Applicable Exclusion Amount has gotten so large, so many clients will have state plans that were structured at a time when they had estate tax exposure; and many still have exposure when considering state taxes. So, what do clients do when after all we have discussed to this point still leaves them with an estate that, if they died today, would owe an estate tax?</p>
  <p> The answer is, they could consider taking steps to reduce the size of their taxable estates while still alive. There are numerous techniques for doing this, but most are beyond the scope of this course; but there are two techniques with which you should be aware. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each technique to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>The first technique is to make lifetime gfits. This can be either in the form of annual exclusion gifts, or direct payments of tuition or medical care on behalf of others.</p>

              <p>The second technique applies to to clients with taxable estates who either own life insurance or plan to own life insurance. For them, it would be preferable to not own policies on their own lives. This is because <strong><em>the death benefit of</em></strong> <strong><em>any life insurance policy they own on their own life will be included in their estate. </em></strong>For example, if a client who owns a $500,000 term life insurance policy, which has no current cash falue, the full $500,000 would be included in the client's estate if the client died today. This would be true even though the policy typically names a beneficiary other than the estate who will receive the money, while the estate is left with any tax liability.</p>
              <p> Obviously, one way around this is to have someone else own the policy. However, that produces its own set of problems, such as giving them control over the policy and potentially subjecting them to tax implications in their own estates if the policy has cash value.</p>
              <p>The more popular option has been to create an Irrevocable Trust, which will be treated as a separate tax entity, and have the policy be owned by the trust. This is known as an <strong><em>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</em></strong>, and we shall explore this in more detail on the next page.            </p>
