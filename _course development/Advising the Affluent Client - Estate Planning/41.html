<p>The $5,430,000 Applicable Exclusion Amount ($10,860,000 for couples) in 2015 means that most affluent clients need no longer be concerned with federal gift and estate taxes. &nbsp;Little, if anything, will need to be done in the way of federal estate and gift tax planning. However, there may be other taxes to consider, and it may be important to address plans that were put in place years ago when federal taxes were more of a concern. The following are considerations for affluent clients to consider during this two-year timespan.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In past years, planning to minimize taxes often led to estate plans that were a compromise between what the client might prefer and what a client felt he/she needed to do to save on taxes. With the elevated Applicable Exclusion Amount, clients may want to re-examine their estate plans to see if they might want to do things differently in a world where estate taxes are not as much of a concern.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" href="javascript:;">Potentially Adverse Effect of Credit Shelter Trusts</a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Many clients have pre-existing estate plans that will fund a Credit Shelter Trust upon death. Many of these were set up primarily for tax reasons and should be reviewed to make sure the plan continues to meet the goals of the client AND to make sure there are no unanticipated or adverse consequences of leaving them in place.</p>
<p>One potential problem is the funding formulas that were commonly used to fund the Credit Shelter Trust. These formulas typically instructed the executor to fund the Credit Shelter Trust with the maximum amount that could be protected by the Federal Estate Tax Credit. If, for example, the estate plan had been put together in 1997, Credit Shelter Trust funding for deaths in that year would have been $600,000. In 2014, it could be as much as $5,430,000. A client adopting an estate plan in 1997 would never have anticipated that the Credit Shelter Trust could be funded with so large an amount. This could result in an unanticipated and undesirable shift in allocation of funds going to various beneficiaries. For example, the client may have felt comfortable at the time with a portion of the estate going into the Credit Shelter Trust to minimize taxes, knowing that the largest share would go to the surviving spouse; however, in 2015, if the estate is under $5,430,000, the entire estate will go to the Credit Shelter Trust and none to the surviving spouse. This may no longer represent the client&rsquo;s preferences.</p>
<p>Another potential problem with leaving a Credit Shelter Trust in place in an older estate plan is that the assets of a Credit Shelter Trust will not get a step-up in basis upon the second spouse's death. With portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount, some clients may prefer to not utilize a Credit Shelter Trust and instead have everything included in the surviving spouse's estate to receive the step-up in basis on the combined estate upon the second death.</p>
<p>For reasons such as these, clients would do well to review their existing estate plans with an estate planning attorney to see if changes need to be made in light of the new rules.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>While we now have a federal estate tax exclusion of $5,430,000 in 2015, many states have a much smaller exclusion amount for state taxes, e.g., $1,000,000, and no portability between spouses. Thus, state transfer taxes have received renewed attention and clients may need to pursue planning strategies with their estate planning attorneys to minimize those taxes. Such plans, such as the use of a Credit Shelter Trust, might have to be balanced against the potential cost of not receiving a step-up in basis upon the second spouse's death.</p>

<p>While testamentary trusts may no longer be needed for minimization of estate taxes, they might nonetheless continue to be useful vehicles for asset protection, e.g., to protect the assets from the creditors of a surviving spouse.</p>

<p>Given the amount of change that has taken place in recent years, clients should be encouraged to review their estate plans with their estate planning attorney. The good news in all of this is that they will have more freedom to make plans that best suit their personal goals than they have ever had before.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness Questions</strong></p>
<p>When you encounter clients or prospects who have not done proper planning or do not review their plans periodically to ensure they are still appropriate, ask them an open-ended question that raises some doubt about their current situation.</p>
