  <p>Now that you have an understanding of the fundamentals of estate and gift taxes, we can begin to illustrate some of the techniques available for minimizing the impact of these taxes.</p>
  <h3>Important Compliance Issues</h3>
  <p>The following pages of this course contain case illustrations designed to help you understand the issues involved in the estate planning process. The content also identifies some practical ways you can engage your clients in effective conversations that help the client understand their need to develop or update their estate plan. While these case study examples are designed to help you develop a deeper understanding of the topic and more confidence, you must remember that <strong>your work must not replace the advice of the client's legal and tax advisors</strong>. Your role is to help your clients <strong><em>realize</em></strong> the need for proper planning and identify <strong><em>potential</em></strong> solutions; not to offer legal or tax advice.</p>
