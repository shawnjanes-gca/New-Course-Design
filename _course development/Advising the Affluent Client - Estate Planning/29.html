<h2>Portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in 2011, a new concept was introduced to the Federal Gift and Estate Tax laws known as the &ldquo;<strong><em>portability</em></strong>&rdquo; of the Applicable Exclusion Amount.&nbsp; By &ldquo;portability,&rdquo; we mean that it is now possible for the unused portion of a deceased spouse&rsquo;s Applicable Exclusion Amount to be transferred (or transported over) at death to the surviving spouse. For this to apply, the death had to occur after 2010.</p>
<p>Stated differently, when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse has their own &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; Exclusion Amount PLUS the <strong><em>&ldquo;Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE) Amount.&rdquo; </em></strong>&nbsp;If someone is predeceased by more than one spouse, then it is the <strong><em>last deceased spouse</em></strong> for whom this portability applies.</p>
<p>This change significantly impacts estate planning and makes it possible for a surviving spouse to have a significantly enhanced Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount for use on the Estate Tax Return. To make use of it, the executor simply files an estate tax return and chooses to not opt out of portability on the return. Furthermore, portability is available for both U.S. citizen and resident alien spouses; it is not available to nonresident aliens.</p>

<p>While this sounds simple, it can actually get a bit complicated. Fortunately, this added complexity makes for some planning risks and opportunities. The best way to illustrate this is with several similar examples, going from the simple to the more complex. Study these examples carefully, as they illustrate some important planning considerations regarding portability.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews died in 2012 when his Applicable Exclusion Amount was $5,120,000. He never made any lifetime taxable gifts and passed his entire estate on to his wife, using the unlimited marital deduction so that his estate would owe no estate taxes. Therefore, his estate used none of his Applicable Exclusion Amount and $5,120,000 of DSUE was passed on to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andrews died in 2016. She, too, had never made any lifetime taxable gifts, so the Applicable Exclusion Amount available to her estate equaled her own 2016 Basic Exclusion Amount of $5,450,000 plus the $5,120,000 DSUE Amount she received from her deceased husband, for a combined total of $10,570,000. <strong><em>Please note that her Basic Exclusion Amount (i.e., her own Applicable Exclusion Amount) was increased by inflation from 2012 to 2015, while the DSUE Amount she received from her deceased husband remained fixed by the year of his death.</em></strong></p>

<p>Jane&rsquo;s first husband died in 2012 when his Applicable Exclusion Amount was $5,120,000. He had never made any lifetime taxable gifts and passed his entire estate on to Jane, utilizing the unlimited marital deduction so that his estate would owe no estate taxes. Therefore, his estate used none of his Applicable Exclusion Amount and $5,120,000 of DSUE was passed on to Jane.</p>
<p>Jane remarried in 2014 and her second husband died in 2015. Jane&rsquo;s second husband had a will that left his entire estate of $10,000,000 to his children from a prior marriage, totally using up his entire Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount and transferring no DSUE to Jane.</p>
<p>Jane died in 2016. According to the rules of portability, her estate can no longer use the $5,120,000 DSUE she received from her first husband&rsquo;s estate because the rules dictate that her estate can only use the DSUE from her <strong><em>last deceased spouse</em></strong>. Unfortunately, her last deceased spouse&rsquo;s estate left her with no DSUE. Thus, her estate is left solely with her own Basic Applicable Exclusion Amount of $5,450,000.</p>
<p><strong><em>This example highlights a risk associated with DSUE and remarriage. In the next example, we will see a planning technique that can potentially address that risk.</em></strong></p>

<p>Sarah&rsquo;s first husband died in 2012 when his Applicable Exclusion Amount was $5,120,000. He had never made any lifetime taxable gifts and passed his entire estate on to Jane, utilizing the unlimited marital deduction so that his estate would owe no estate taxes. Therefore, his estate used none of his Applicable Exclusion Amount and $5,120,000 of DSUE was passed on to Sarah.</p>
<p>Sarah remarried in 2014. Immediately upon remarriage, she made taxable gifts in the amount of $5,120,000 to her children from her prior marriage. The rules dictate that when a surviving spouse with DSUE makes lifetime taxable gifts, the DSUE is used up before the surviving spouse&rsquo;s own Basic Credit. Thus, in making the gifts to the children, Sarah totally used up the DSUE from her first husband.</p>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s second husband died in 2015 when his Applicable Exclusion Amount was $5,430,000. He had never made any lifetime taxable gifts and passed his entire estate on to Sarah. His estate used none of his Applicable Exclusion Amount and, <strong><em>since he was now her last deceased spouse</em></strong>, his estate transferred $5,430,000 of DSUE to Sarah.</p>
<p>Sarah died in 2016. Her Applicable Exclusion Amount equals her own Basic Exclusion Amount of $5,450,000 plus the $5,430,000 DSUE Amount she received from her second deceased husband (now the last deceased husband), for a combined total of $10,880,000.</p>
<p>This example highlights a planning opportunity associated with DSUE and remarriage. Realizing the risk that she could lose the DSUE from her first deceased husband if her second husband predeceased her, Sarah quickly used up the DSUE from her first deceased husband. The end result was that <strong><em>Sarah got to make use of the DSUE from both of her deceased husbands and had sufficient transfer tax credits to protect a total of $16,000,000 from taxation.</em></strong></p>
