  <p>To understand how to minimize the effects of federal gift and estate taxes, you need to first understand some of the fundamentals regarding this form of taxation. The Federal Estate and Gift Tax System is commonly referred to as the federal &quot;Transfer Tax System&quot; because it deals with the taxation applied to the "transfer" of assets. Although there are exceptions, some of which will be addressed in this training, any transfer of assets from one party to another is potentially a taxable event.  Knowing when these taxes apply is crucial.</p>
  <p> There is also a federal Generation Skipping Transfer Tax for very large cumulative transfers to lineal descendents that skip a generation or go to non-related individuals 37½ years younger than the donor. This, too, is part of the federal Transfer Tax System, but further details regarding this tax shall be beyond the scope of this course.</p>
  <h3> Estate and Gift Taxes Have Much In Common</h3>
  <p> At one point in our history, lifetime transfers (gift taxes) were taxed under a system that was totally separate from the taxation of transfers upon death (estate taxes). However, in 1976, the federal estate and gift tax systems were &quot;unified&quot; and have shared many common elements since that time, the most important of which has been a unified tax rate schedule. A short history of this development is provided on the next page and will provide you with the context for better understanding our current system of transfer taxation.</p>
