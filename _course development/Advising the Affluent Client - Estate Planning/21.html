  <p>Fortunately, we are not taxed on all transfers in life and at death. There are certain deductions that we are allowed to make <strong><em>before</em></strong> the tentative tax is calculated. Two important deductions that are available for both gift and estate taxes are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span><strong>The Unlimited Marital Deduction</strong>--Transfers of assets between spouses are non-taxable events      regarding transfer taxes. This is true for lifetime gifts or for      inheritances.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Charitable Deductions--</strong>Transfers to qualified charities, during      one's lifetime or at death, are not subject to transfer taxes.</span></li>
  </ol>
