    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Fortunately, we are not taxed on all transfers in life and at death. There are certain deductions that we are allowed to make <strong><em>before</em></strong> the tentative tax is calculated. Two important deductions that are available for both gift and estate taxes are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span><strong>The Unlimited Marital Deduction</strong>--Transfers of assets between spouses are non-taxable events      regarding transfer taxes. This is true for lifetime gifts or for      inheritances.</span>
      <div class="example-box"><span> Beware, however, if a spouse is not a U.S. citizen. Non-U.S. citizen spouses are not automatically entitled to the Unlimited Marital Deduction and additional planning must be done in order to get them in a position to receive assets free of estate taxes.</span></div>
      <!-- example-box -->
    </li>
    <li><span><strong>Charitable Deductions--</strong>Transfers to qualified charities, during      one's lifetime or at death, are not subject to transfer taxes.</span></li>
  </ol>
