<p>Prior to the 20th century, an estate tax was implemented numerous times, always as a temporary measure of short duration. It was used to help pay for the Civil War, to help build the Navy, and to help pay for the Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, in 1916 as the United States was nearing entry into World War I, Congress passed an estate tax as a &ldquo;temporary measure&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This tax has been with us ever since. As the public began to realize that this tax was not going away, an easy solution was to not own anything when you die; just give it away while you're alive.</p>
<p>This led to a rise of &ldquo;death-bed-transfers.&rdquo; Before you die, you call your doctor and you call your attorney.</p>

<p>To address the growing attempts to avoid the estate tax through lifetime gifts, in 1924 Congress passed the Gift Tax.</p>
<p>This tax was separate and independent from the estate tax. Both the estate tax and the gift tax were calculated without consideration of the other.</p>
<p>The gift tax rate was also 25% lower than the rate for estates, so there remained an incentive to give lifetime gifts rather than be taxed on assets at death.</p>
<p>In time, the public began to find ways to take advantage of this structure and became more creative with its use of lifetime gifts.</p>
<p>There was a growing use of trusts as a vehicle by which to transfer assets. For example, I could place an asset in trust, thereby no longer owning it, yet retain all the benefits of ownership. I might retain the right to all the income, retain the right to use the asset, or retain the right to continue voting the stock.</p>
<p>There was also an interest in multi-generation transfers. If the IRS was going to tax transfers in each generation, then I could achieve a considerable tax savings by transferring assets directly to my grandchildren, rather than first transferring them to my children where they would be taxed upon my children's death.</p>

<p>To address these issues, in 1976 Congress implemented a Unified Estate and Gift Tax.</p>
<p>It was a unified system in that both the estate tax and the gift tax used the same tax rate schedule. Whether the transfer was made in life or at death, the same tax rates would be applied.</p>
<p>It was also unified in the sense that the estate tax and the gift tax would no longer be calculated independently. Instead, there would be consideration of lifetime gifts when computing estate taxes.</p>
<p>Here was the premise: the IRS would charge the same tax regardless of when the transfer occurred. To accomplish this, when you die, all post-1976 taxable gifts will be added back to your estate. The result is that you would compute your estate tax as if you had never given these amounts away.</p>
<p>A final thing the unified system did was address some of those transfers where people were retaining power over assets as if they still owned them outright. Essentially, the new rules said that if you made transfers in which you retained too much power, then they were considered incomplete transfers and the assets would be added back to your estate upon your death.</p>
<p>The final thing Congress did in 1976 was address the strategy to avoid the estate tax by skipping generations. Congress addressed this with a totally independent tax known as the &ldquo;Generation Skipping Transfer Tax.&rdquo; Essentially, this legislation said that sizeable transfers that skip a generation will be subject to an additional tax, assessed at the highest rate on the Unified Estate and Gift Tax Schedule.</p>
<p>Although there have been some reforms along the way, and we will talk about those, the 1976 legislation is essentially the tax system we have today. This course will flesh out more of the details as to how this system of taxation works.</p>
