  <p>A sizeable portion of charitable gifts are made at death rather than during life because many people, while desiring to support charities, fear that making gifts to a charity during their lifetime may result in them outliving their assets.  However, in many situations, that fear is unfounded.  In fact, making lifetime gifts, as mentioned in the last case study, can be a far superior means of realizing their charitable intent, while increasing their lifetime income.  This is illustrated in the following situation.</p>
<div class="example-box">
	<h3>Situation</h3>
  <p>Suppose an elderly client has $4.5 million, of which $1 million is in an asset with a basis of $30,000. The client receives a dividend yield on the asset of approximately 1.5%, or $15,000 per year. The client would like more income, but doesn't want to pay the capital gains tax for selling the asset.  The client plans to give $1 million to a university upon his death.</p>
  <div>
  	<em class="explanation-widget-box">
    	<h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
A solution is to create a Charitable Remainder Trust and fund it with the $1 million appreciated asset.  A Charitable Remainder Trust is a trust where the grantor receives an income benefit during life, with the asset going to the charity upon death.  Here is a possible result for taking this step:</p>
	<ul>
  	<li>The client receives an immediate income tax deduction for the charitable gift. This deduction can be spread over 5 years of income tax returns.</li>
	<li>The trust is structured to provide an annuity to the grantor for life, or for a specific number of years (up to 20).  In this case, let's suppose it is a 6% annuity, or $60,000 per year, significantly increasing his income.</li> 
	<li>The charity will be free to liquidate the asset to reinvest in income-producing securities, without suffering the impact of capital gains taxes.  The asset can then be reinvested to generate higher income, thereby minimizing or totally eliminating (depending upon market conditions) the need to use principal to make the annuity payments.</li>
	<li>No capital gains are paid when making the gift.</li>
	<li>Upon his death (or at the end of the designated number of years), the trust terminates and the university receives the principal outright.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Through use of a Charitable Remainder Trust, or a Pooled Income Fund which operates similarly but is designed for smaller accounts, people can not only reduce their estate tax exposure, if any, but often improve their current income situation by making the charitable transfer while alive rather than waiting until they are dead.</p>

    <h3>Awareness Questions</h3>
    <p>To help a client/prospect understand the immediate benefits of a charitable gifting strategy, ask them the following questions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>How have you assessed the benefits of gifting to charities while alive rather than waiting until your death?</span></li>
      <li><span>How have you structured your estate plan to maximize the impact of your charitable intent?</span></li>
