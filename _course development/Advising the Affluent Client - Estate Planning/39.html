  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Why Should Older Estate Plans be Reviewed to Consider Utilizing Portability?</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>On the previous page, we discussed the fact that there is still a role to be played by Credit Shelter Trusts and Marital Trusts. That is not to say, however, that all pre-2011 plans that made use of these techniques are still optimal now that we have the option of utilizing portability of the DSUE. These older plans should be reviewed for a number of reasons to make sure they are still optimally meeting client goals. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each reason to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>In past years, planning to minimize taxes often led to estate plans that were a compromise between what the client might prefer and what a client felt he/she needed to do to save on taxes. With the elevated Applicable Exclusion Amount, clients should re-examine their estate plans to see if they might want to do things differently in a world where estate taxes are not as much of a concern.</p>
              <p>For example, a client who previously established an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust to provide liquidity for estate taxes may no longer have a taxable estate. In that case, the Life Insurance Trust should be reviewed to see what options are available under the terms of the trust. </p>

              <p>Many clients have pre-existing estate plans that will fund a Credit Shelter Trust upon death. Many of these were set up primarily for tax reasons and should be reviewed to make sure the plan continues to meet the goals of the client AND to make sure there are no unanticipated or adverse consequences of leaving them in place. </p>
              <p> One potential problem is the funding formulas that were commonly used to fund the Credit Shelter Trust. These formulas typically instructed the executor to fund the Credit Shelter Trust with the maximum amount that could be protected by the Federal Estate Tax Credit. If, for example, the estate plan had been put together in 1997, Credit Shelter Trust funding for deaths in that year would have been $600,000. In 2016, it could be as much as $5,450,000. A client adopting an estate plan in 1997 would never have anticipated that the Credit Shelter Trust could be funded with so large an amount. This could result in an unanticipated and undesirable shift in allocation of funds going to various beneficiaries. </p>
              <p> For example, the client may have felt comfortable at the time with a portion of the estate going into the Credit Shelter Trust to minimize taxes, knowing that the largest share would go to the surviving spouse. However, in 2016, if the estate is under $5,450,000, the entire estate will go to the Credit Shelter Trust and none to the surviving spouse. This may no longer represent the client's preferences. </p>
              <p> Another potential problem with leaving a Credit Shelter Trust in place in an older estate plan is that the assets of a Credit Shelter Trust will not get a step-up in tax basis upon the second spouse's death. With portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount, some clients may prefer to not utilize a Credit Shelter Trust and instead have everything included in the surviving spouse's estate to receive the step-up in tax basis on the combined estate upon the second death.</p>
              <p>For reasons such as these, clients would do well to review their existing estate plans with an estate planning attorney to see if changes need to be made in light of the new rules. </p>

              <p>For clients who have taxable estates, lifetime gifting continues to be an excellent means for reducing the size of the taxable estate and for keeping future appreciation out of the estate.</p>
              <p>Given that the Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax Exemption has also risen to $5,450,000 in 2016, it may be especially attractive to set up trusts for grandchildren. In this regard, it is important to note that there is no portability of the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Exemption. If the desire is to use both spouse's exemption for this purpose, it will be important to make plans for utilization of the exemption in each spouse's estate, since the surviving spouse cannot inherit the GST exemption from the deceased spouse. </p>

              <p>While we now have a federal estate tax exclusion of $5,450,000 in 2016, many states have a much smaller exclusion amount, e.g., $1,000,000. Thus, state transfer taxes have received renewed attention and clients may need to pursue planning strategies with their estate planning attorneys to minimize those taxes. These plans might still make use of the Credit Shelter Trust, which might have to be balanced against the potential cost of not receiving a step-up in basis on the trust assets upon the second spouse's death.</p>

              <p>While testamentary trusts may no longer be needed for minimization of estate taxes, they might nonetheless continue to be useful vehicles for asset protection, e.g., to protect the assets from the creditors of a surviving spouse. This might be a good reason, for example, for leaving a previous estate plan that funds a Credit Shelter Trust in place.</p>

  <p>Given the amount of change that has taken place in recent years, clients should be encouraged to review their estate plans with their estate planning attorney. The good news in all of this is that they will have more freedom to make plans that best suit their personal goals than they have ever had before.</p>
