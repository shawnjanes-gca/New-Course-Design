<h2>The Rules Under the 2010 Tax Relief Act</h2>

<p>Now that you have an understanding of the rules and techniques that governed gift and estate taxes leading up to 2010, let's look at how the 2010 Tax Relief Act changed things for 2010-2012. On the next page, we will look at the 2012 Tax Relief Act and how it changed things for 2013 and beyond.</p>
<p>The first thing the 2010 Act did was to reinstate the estate tax for 2010. For persons who died in 2010, executors were given the option of having no estate taxation (with limited step-up of basis on assets), as was dictated by the 2001 Tax Relief Act, or having an estate tax (with full step-up of basis) under the rules of the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Depending upon the assets in question, one approach could be preferable to the other, and executors were free to choose between the two methods.</p>
<p>The second thing the 2010 Tax Relief Act did was to establish the rules for 2011 and 2012, which were as follows:</p>

<div id="p7ABW1" class="p7AB">
<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_1" href="javascript:;">Applicable Exclusion Amount of $5,000,000 (indexed for inflation to $5,120,000 in 2012)</a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>For 2011, the Applicable Exclusion Amount was $5,000,000. For 2012, it was indexed for inflation and was $5,120,000. This marked a significant increase from only a decade ago, making federal estate taxes a non-issue for most Americans. However, the legislation did not go beyond 2012, creating uncertainty as to whether or not this high amount would continue past 2012. This uncertainly was particularly acute because if Congress failed to take action, beginning in 2013 the Exclusion Amount would fall to $1,000,000.</p>
</div>

<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" href="javascript:;">Unification of the Estate and Gift Tax</a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>No longer were lifetime taxable gifts limited to only using a portion of the Applicable Credit/Exclusion Amount. Under the new legislation, the full Applicable Exclusion Amount ($5,000,000 in 2011 and $5,120,000 in 2012) could be used for lifetime gifts. This created an expanded opportunity for wealthy individuals to make large lifetime transfers. Again, this legislation did not go beyond 2012, and absent further legislation by Congress, in 2013 the Applicable Exclusion Amount (all of which could still be used for lifetime taxable gifts) would fall to $1,000,000. This uncertainty led to heightened interest in lifetime transfer strategies that took advantage of the high Exclusion Amount out of fear that the opportunity would evaporate at the end of 2012.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_3" href="javascript:;">Portability of the Applicable Exclusion Amount to the Surviving Spouse</a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>By portability, we mean that it became possible for a deceased spouse to pass on his or her own Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE) Amount to the surviving spouse. Thus, any unused balance up to their full Applicable Exclusion Amount at the time of death could be passed on to the surviving spouse by making the appropriate election on the deceased spouse&rsquo;s estate tax return.</p>
<p>In short, when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse has their own Basic Exclusion Amount PLUS the &ldquo;Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE) Amount &ldquo; that can be applied against gift or estate taxes. If someone is predeceased by more than one spouse, then it is the last deceased spouse for whom this portability applies. Note, however, that the 2010 Tax Relief Act only addressed the rules through 2012. Thus, portability could have potentially gone away in 2013, depending upon future actions of Congress. So here, too, there was great uncertainty regarding the future of portability and how to best plan for its use.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Transfers beyond the Applicable Exclusion Amount were taxed at 35%.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_5" href="javascript:;">Unlimited Step-Up in Basis at Death</a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_5">
<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>The tax basis of estate assets were stepped up to date of death value or, if the executor so elects, the value on the alternate valuation date that occurs 6 months after death. Unlike the other rules, there was some certainty. Even if Congress failed to take further action, this would continue in 2013 and beyond.</p>

<p>As you can see from the rules for 2011 and 2012, the Tax Relief Act left much uncertainty regarding the future. It took the Tax Relief Act of 2012 to remove that uncertainty.</p>
