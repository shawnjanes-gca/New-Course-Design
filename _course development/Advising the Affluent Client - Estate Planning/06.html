  <p>One of the most powerful estate planning tools for providing protection for an individual and the individual's family is a trust.  This is because a trust can continue functioning, in accordance with the purposes and guidelines with which it was established, despite the incapacity or death of the person who established it.  This makes it possible to provide some degree of financial protection against the possibility of a period of incapacity, without the need of a court-appointed guardian of the property.  It also makes it possible to provide post-death financial protection for family members.  To better understand how this is accomplished, let's first elaborate on the nature of a trust.</p>
 <p>A trust is a <strong><em><a href="#" id="p7Tooltip_1" class="p7TTM_trg" title="The term “fiduciary” is derived from Roman law, and applies to a person or entity that has accepted a responsibility that must be performed in the best interests of another person or entity.  In other words, action cannot be based on self-interest; the interest of another must come first.">fiduciary</a></em></strong> <strong><em><a href="#" title="As a &quot;relationship,&quot; it must be freely entered into.  Just because someone is named to assume this obligation (as trustee), does not obligate him or her to act in this capacity.  It is always possible to &quot;disclaim the appointment.&quot;  But once accepted, the responsibility is legally binding." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">relationship</a></em></strong> whereby one <strong><em><a href="#" title="The parties to the relationship may be individuals or institutions." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" >party</a></em></strong>, the trustee, takes <strong><em><a href="#" title="The party acting in this fiduciary capacity is called a Trustee. Unlike someone who has a power of attorney or someone who is acting as an agent or custodian, the trustee actually takes legal title to all property held in the trust. " class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">title</a></em></strong> to <strong><em><a href="#" title="Trusts are created for the purpose of managing property and utilizing it for specific purposes. Without property, there is no effective trust. All too frequently people create trust documents, only to fail to properly fund them." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">property</a></em></strong> for the sole purpose of managing it for the benefit of a designated party, the beneficiary(ies). </p>
 <p>While trusts can be created verbally, this course will only deal with trusts that are created by written agreement.  Under such agreements, property is transferred only when the receiving party agrees to abide by the terms of the agreement.  </p>
<p> In drafting trust agreements, care must be taken to make sure there is no conflict with the will.  This is important because assets owned by the trust will be administered by the terms of the trust.  Unless the trust is required to distribute assets to the estate, the will has no authority over trust assets.  For this reason, wills and trust agreements are customarily treated as complementary tools in estate planning.</p>
