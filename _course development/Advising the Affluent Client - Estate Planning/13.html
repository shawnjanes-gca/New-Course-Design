  <p>What happens when a person dies <a href="#" title="<strong>Intestate -</strong> Having died without a will." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">intestate</a>? Essentially, state law will decide how assets are distributed. These statutes vary from state to state, but there is typically some split of assets between the spouse and the children. If there is no surviving spouse or children, then the assets typically go to the parents, then brothers and sisters, then cousins and nephews, etc. </p>
<p>Note: In community property states (e.g., Alaska (optional), Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), <a href="#" title="Generally, &lt;strong&gt;separate property&lt;/strong&gt; is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Property that an individual acquired prior to marriage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gift or inheritance specifically given to an individual spouse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compensation for personal injuries of an individual spouse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individually owned property acquired prior to moving to a community property state&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">community property</a> goes to the surviving spouse, with the remaining <a href="#" title="Generally, &lt;strong&gt;community property&lt;/strong&gt; consists of income earned while married and property purchased with such earnings.  Upon death, 50% of community property is included in the deceased spouse’s estate." class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">separate property</a> owned by the deceased passing by state law in a manner similar to all other states. </p>
<p>While these statutes are equitable, taking into consideration the interests of both the spouse and children, they rarely accomplish what the decedent would have preferred.</p>

  The diagram on the right illustrates what happens in most states when a person dies without a will and is survived by a spouse and children. </p>
            <p> If survived by a spouse and children, most states split the assets between the surviving spouse and the children, with the spouse receiving 1/3 or 1/2 of the assets. This is true regardless of the age of the children. </p>
Note:  In community property states, such distributions would only pertain to separately owned property, since all community property would go to the surviving spouse.          </div>

            <p>Because children cannot own property, their inheritance may require the appointment of a guardian to handle the property.  While the property is administered in a guardianship, accountings to the court may be required and court approval may be needed for the sale of assets or their use on behalf of the children.  Therefore, alternative planning that does not involve a court-monitored guardianship is typically preferred.</p>
            <p>For example, a trust could be created to hold the funds for the children and a trustee could be empowered to use his or her own discretion (not the court's) in making distributions for their health, education, maintenance, and support.  The trust might further direct that the children start receiving the trust income at age 18, receive one-third of the principal at age 21, one-half of the balance of the principal at age 25, and the balance of the funds at age 30. </p>
