  <p>A will also allows you to select the person or institution that will be empowered by the court to settle your estate.  Depending upon the state, the person who is designated to settle the estate is referred to as the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;executor - male&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;executrix - female&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">executor</a> or <strong>personal representative</strong>, and the court that has jurisdiction over the proceeding is referred to as the <strong>probate <em>(adj.)</em> court</strong> (in some jurisdictions, it may be referred to as the <strong>surrogate court</strong>). </p>
<p>The process of settling an estate through the court is referred to as <strong>probate <em>(n.)</em></strong>, and to go through that process is to <strong>probate <em>(v.)</em></strong> the estate.  That this is done as a court-monitored process reflects the fact that the will is viewed as a legally enforceable document, the instructions of which are binding upon the personal representative.  Being a legal document, it should be drafted by an attorney.</p>
