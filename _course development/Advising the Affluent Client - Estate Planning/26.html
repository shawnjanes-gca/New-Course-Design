  </h1>
  <p>One of the goals in creating a unified gift and estate tax system was to ultimately have everyone make the same transfer tax calculation regardless of the timing of the transfers. Just how this is accomplished is illustrated in the following example.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
  <h3><strong>Mr. Jones' Story</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Mr. Jones made taxable gifts during his lifetime (after 1976) of $800,000. He died in 2016 with an estate valued at $6,200,000. How do you take into account his lifetime gifts in computing his estate tax?</p>
  <div id="p7SMLcontent_1" class="sml-content indented">
    <div id="p7SMLwrapper_1">
      <h3><strong>Answer</strong></h3>
      <p>First, add together his lifetime taxable gifts (those made after 1976) and his final estate value, deriving a total of $7 million. Then compute the tax on $7 million, deriving his tentative estate tax. <br>
        If he paid any prior tax on his lifetime gifts (a likelihood if the bulk of his taxable gifts were made prior to 2002 when the cumulative amount that could be gifted without paying a tax was less than the cumulative $800,000 he gifted), then give him a credit in that amount against his estate tax.</p>
      The result is that Mr. Jones' estate tax is calculated on $7,000,000, which is the same amount he would have used if he had never made lifetime taxable gifts (ignoring potential market value changes). This illustrates how two people with the same size estate will ultimately make the same estate tax calculation, even though one person made lifetime taxable gifts and the other did not. To be sure, there may be value in getting assets out of your estate during life because the appreciation on those assets will not be in your estate when you die; but ignoring market value changes, the tax calculation itself will be the same.</div>

<p>The concept illustrated by the example above is very important to remember. <strong><em>Lifetime taxable gifts (made after 1976) are added back whenever a Federal Gift or Estate Tax Return is filed.</em></strong> Thus, the calculation is always a cumulative calculation of all taxable transfers since 1976. A credit, which we will discuss later, is available against the calculated tax. Furthermore, if any gift taxes were previously paid on lifetime transfers, then credit against the current tax calculation will also be given for prior taxes paid.</p>
