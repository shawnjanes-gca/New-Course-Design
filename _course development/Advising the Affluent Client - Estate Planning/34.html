<h2>Introducing the Credit Shelter Trust</h2>

<p>The Credit Shelter Trust (sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;Applicable Exclusion Trust,&rdquo; "By-Pass Trust," or "Family Trust&rdquo;) became very popular as a means of utilizing the applicable credit amount when the first spouse died. Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the first spouse dies, the Applicable Credit Amount is generally applied against as much of the estate as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These "sheltered" assets are transferred into a "credit shelter trust."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remaining assets, which are not covered by the applicable credit amount, are transferred to the surviving spouse (or, as we shall explore in the following case study, into a trust for the surviving spouse).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The surviving spouse generally receives income from the credit shelter trust and, if the document allows, can receive principal at the trustee's discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credit shelter trust can also be used for the children. For this reason, it is often referred to as a "<strong>family trust</strong>." In fact, after the death of the surviving spouse, the trust can continue for the benefit of the children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the surviving spouse cannot control the credit shelter trust, it is not included in the surviving spouse's estate and will not be taxed upon the second death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end result is that both applicable credit amounts are utilized and the surviving spouse does not have to forego benefit of all the assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If Joe and Martha Andrews had divided their assets equally and utilized the credit shelter trust technique in their estate planning documents, the end result would have been <strong>no estate taxes</strong>, at a savings of $90,000 (if they both died in 2009), as illustrated in the diagram on the right.</p>
<p>For many years, this has been one of the most powerful estate planning techniques available for couples, and its features became second nature to planners.</p>
