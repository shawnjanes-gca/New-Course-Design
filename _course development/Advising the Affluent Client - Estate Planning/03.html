<p>To identify needs and potential solutions, it is necessary to first understand the environment in which a response is formulated. Depending upon the need being addressed, this may require an understanding of essential vocabulary, legal requirements, taxation, etc. After the needs have been identified, your client should work with his or her legal and tax advisors to design the plan that will address the need. Please note that your work must not replace the advice of the client's legal and tax advisors.</p>

<p>It is not enough that you understand the need and possible solutions; nothing will happen until your client <strong><em>sees</em></strong> the need and <strong><em>wants</em></strong> a solution. Therefore, for each of the primary client needs, we will discuss effective methods you can use to help your client see the need and want a solution.</p>

<p>This last step of getting the client to recognize the need and desire a solution requires some understanding of how people make the decision to "buy," whether they are buying something tangible like a car or a planning solution. Therefore, we will explore this methodology of converting a need to a want on the next page, and then proceed on to addressing each of the six needs listed above.</p>
