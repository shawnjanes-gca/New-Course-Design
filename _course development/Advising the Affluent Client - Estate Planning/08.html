  <p>The specific terms and purposes of the agreements are infinite in their variety. But despite these differences, all trusts consist of three parties, as diagramed below:</p>

              <p>This is the person who creates the trust.  Alternatively, this person is referred to as the trustor or settlor.  Any legally competent adult can create a trust by having a trust agreement drafted and transferring assets into the trust.</p>
The grantor can be distinct from the beneficiary and trustee, but can simultaneously be either the beneficiary or trustee, or both.  For example, it is quite common for people to establish a living trust in which the grantor acts as the trustee and receives all the benefits while alive.            </div>

              <p>This is the person or institution that takes title to the property, agrees to be governed by the trust document, and agrees to act on behalf of the beneficiary.  If there is more than one trustee, they are referred to as <strong><em>co-trustees</em></strong>.</p>
In fulfilling the duties, the Trustee may have as much or as little power as the grantor chose to relinquish, as stated in the terms of the agreement.  Any legally competent adult can be a Trustee.            </div>

              <p>The beneficiary is the person(s) or entity(ies) for whom the benefit of the trust is intended.  Some beneficiaries may be <strong>current beneficiaries</strong>, meaning they receive a current benefit, such as income, from the trust.  Others may be <strong>future beneficiaries</strong>, meaning they will not receive any benefit until some future point in time.  Quite often, the future beneficiaries are to receive the assets of the trust upon the death of the current beneficiaries.  For example, a trust may exist to pay income for the lifetime of a surviving spouse (the current beneficiary), but terminate upon the surviving spouse's death and distribute the assets to the surviving children (future beneficiaries).</p>
