  <p>The considerations on the prior page make a strong case for considering the appointment of a corporate trustee or executor.Â  The benefits of a corporate trustee or executor are quite significant:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Experience</li>
    <li>Expertise</li>
    <li>Impartiality </li>
    <li>Continuity </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="explanation-widget-box">If you work for an institution that offers estate settlement or trust services, you may be in a position to guide your client to a more appropriate solution.  Therefore, if a client/prospect has selected an individual as trustee or executor, help him or her assess the appropriateness of such a selection by asking questions such as the following:
  <ul>
  	<li>	How have you determined that your current executor (or trustee) has the expertise necessary to settle your estate (or administer your trust)?</li>
	<li>How have you protected against your estate becoming a source of division in your family after your death?</li>
  </ul>
