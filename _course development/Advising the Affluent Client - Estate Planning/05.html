  <p><strong><em>Estate planning is primarily about planning for the transfer and application of assets</em></strong>.  This is an important issue for everyone who owns assets because all of us are mortal and will eventually die.  That means the assets we own <em>will</em> someday transfer to someone, whether we plan for the event or don't.  Those assets will also be applied to achieving someone's goals.  Without planning, they may serve someone else's goals, not our own.</p>
  <p> Far and away the most common estate planning mistakes individuals make is failing to put in place any plan at all.&nbsp; In fact, a recent survey sponsored by LexisNexis found that the majority of Americans (58%) do not have a basic will.  The powerful message contained within this staggering statistic is simple - a significant opportunity to distinguish yourself  and capture assets exists with many of the affluent individuals you encounter every day.</p>
  <h3> Potential Implications</h3>
  <p> Understanding that many people fail to engage in thoughtful planning, let's examine the potential implications.&nbsp; Although the consequences of not planning are far too numerous to list completely, the following are a few that should be considered.&nbsp;<span class="pageInstruction">Click each consequence to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>Simple planning can eliminate or defer estate taxes for many individuals. Even with the Tax Relief Act of 2012, which prevents federal Gift and Estate taxes from being a significant issue for most affluent clients, there may still be state tax issues for many to consider. Therefore, for some affluent clients, estate taxes could be considered a choice - either choose to plan or, if by default you have a taxable estate, choose to pay taxes.</p>

<p>Another important issue that many affluent clients fail to properly address is how their property is titled. The titling of assets can itself be a form of estate planning, with implications that often escape the notice of clients. Clients often generate consequences they never intended through the titling of their assets, even when an estate plan has been put in place. The importance of properly titling assets is illustrated in the following case:</p>
<div class="explanation-widget-box">
  	<h3>The Case of Unintended Results</h3>
		<p>Jim and Mary Jones married 15 years ago after previous divorces, each with a child from prior marriages. The children were grown when the marriage occurred and have never gotten along. Three years ago, Mary began to show signs of Alzheimer's and Jim has been her sole caregiver until his recent death. Mary's health is not good and she is not expected to live much longer.</p>
		<p>Jim's estate is valued at $1.2 million and Mary's is worth $1 million. At his death, Jim's will directs his assets to go into a trust until Mary's death, at which time the trust will terminate and the assets will be distributed to his child. Mary has a similar will, with assets ultimately going to her own child. When the wills were executed, the documents were consistent with the desire of each spouse to ultimately pass on their estates to their respective children.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, after putting the plan together, neither spouse paid attention to how titling of assets might affect this plan. Among Jim's estate assets, $500,000 is his half interest in their house and the balance of his estate is in an investment account; both the house and investment account are titled as joint tenants with right of survivorship with Mary. Consequently, all of Jim's assets will transfer at death directly to Mary, completely bypassing Jim's will. In short, this failure to be mindful of the titling of their assets has undermined the intent of their estate plan and will potentially disinherit Jim's child.</p>

<h3>Awareness Questions</h3>
<p>When you encounter a client that has not done proper planning or does not review their plan periodically to ensure it is appropriate, ask the client the following questions.</p>
