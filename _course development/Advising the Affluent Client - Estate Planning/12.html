  <p>The primary instrument for providing control over <strong><em>who</em></strong> receives assets upon death is the will.  By complementing the will with one or more trusts, created either while alive or at death, it also becomes possible to control <strong><em>when</em></strong> people receive assets.   Together, these form the core of an effective estate plan.  We've already discussed trusts and illustrated how they can provide control over the timing of transfers.  Let's now examine the will.</p>
  <p> Most people do not have wills.  They either assume their estates are too small to bother or they procrastinate planning for their own demise.  Yet a will is the most basic of estate planning documents. </p>
  <p> A will is an instrument by which a <a href="#" title="testator - male&lt;br&gt;testatrix - female" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">person</a> declares instructions for the disposition of his or her property at death.  While some property may transfer by virtue of its title (e.g., property held in joint tenancy), by virtue of being held in a trust, or by contract (e.g., life insurance proceeds), the remaining property must be transferred through the will and be administered (probated) through the court.  The most common form of will is the Simple Will, also known as an "I Love You Will."  Here, all assets owned by the first spouse pass free of income and estate taxes to the surviving spouse using the unlimited marital deduction.</p>

                <p>A will helps establish the testator's state of residency, also referred to as the testator's domicile.  While moving to another state does not invalidate a will, it is usually desirable for the will to reflect the current domicile.  This clarifies where the estate will be administered and what laws will govern.  It also helps to establish residence for state income tax purposes. </p>
