<p>Although common, it is often a mistake to name an individual to serve as trustee or executor. Since the trustee/executor is responsible for handling all of the affairs of the estate after one's death, most people choose a family member or close friend to serve in this capacity. While it may be viewed as an honor to be named as someone's executor or trustee, it can be a difficult and time-consuming task. There is the further potential that the executor may be placed in the middle of a family squabble over the estate, which is particularly troubling if the executor is a family member. The same is true for a trustee, whom the beneficiaries may resent as standing between them and "their money." There is much to consider in both the selection of an executor/trustee and in accepting such an appointment.</p>
