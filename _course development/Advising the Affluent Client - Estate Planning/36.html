<p>While transferring assets that did not qualify for the credit shelter trust directly to a U.S. citizen surviving spouse was one means of applying the unlimited marital deduction to avoid taxes when the first spouse died, it was actually more common to see these assets transferred to a marital trust. This two-trust arrangement of a credit shelter trust and a marital trust is commonly referred to as A - B Trusts, where the A trust is the marital trust, and the B trust is the credit shelter (&ldquo;by-pass&rdquo;) trust.</p>
<p>In this arrangement, the surviving spouse receives the income from the trust and also has a <strong><em>General Power of Appointment </em></strong>over the assets in the marital trust. What that means is that the surviving spouse can appoint those assets to whomever he/she chooses, even to himself/herself.</p>
<p>This arrangement would certainly address Mr. Diamond's concern that his wife be protected from the burden of handling the finances, since the assets can be handled by a competent trustee. The terms of the trust (as well as the terms of the credit shelter trust) could also read that upon the death of the surviving spouse, the trust is to continue for the benefit of the handicapped son until his death, then to terminate and be distributed to the surviving children or their surviving families.</p>
