              <li>Federal gift and estate taxes      are no longer a consideration for most affluent clients today because of      the size of the Applicable Exclusion Amount and the advent of portability,      which makes it possible for married couples to use both spouses'      Applicable Exclusion Amounts without having to develop estate plans that      include trusts.</li>
              <li>For most affluent clients      living in states with an estate or inheritance tax, the focus of planning      to minimize estate taxes has shifted from federal transfer taxes to state      transfer taxes.</li>
              <li>While Credit Shelter      trusts are no longer required to preserve the Federal Applicable Exclusion      Amount for both spouses, they still might have many non-tax uses for      controlled distribution of assets to family members, anticipated      inheritances of surviving spouse, etc. </li>
              <li>There is also a continued      need for Credit Shelter/Marital Trust (A-B Trust) planning in the case of      second marriages, with children of a prior marriage are involved, of when      thre is likelihood of remarriage of a surviving spouse.</li>
              <li>Irrevocable Life Insurance      Trusts continue to be viable means of reducing the size of one's taxable      estate, especialy in states where there is a state estate tax with a      credit that is much lower than the federal Applicable Credit Amount.</li>
              <li>Pre-existing plans should      be re-examined in light of current law, as the techniques utilized (such      as funding clauses) may no longer be consistent with the preferences of      the client.</li>
              <li>The higher exclusion amounts mean that most affluent clients can focus on personal estate planning goals rather than being overly concerned with minimization of estate taxes.          </li>
