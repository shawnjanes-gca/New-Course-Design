    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>In most states, a wide range of property types may be held in an FLP as denoted in the chart to the right..</p>
  <p>However, not every asset should be transferred to FLP ownership as denoted below:</p>
  <table>

        <li>Ownership of a personal use non-income-producing asset may void the business purpose of the FLP. </li>

        <li>Mortgage interest may no longer be deductible.</li>

      <th scope="row"><strong>IRA</strong></th>
      <td><ul>
        <li>Immediate taxation of all deferred income.</li>
        <li>The transfer of the IRA to an FLP may  be deemed a taxable distribution from the IRA.</li>

<p>Taxes can be significantly reduced through the use of the FLP.  Because the FLP is a &ldquo;flow-through&rdquo; entity for income tax purposes, partnership income is taxed only to the partners and the partnership itself generally pays no income taxes.</p>
<p>FLPs are a long-term favorite of estate planners as well. Through creative use of the limited partnership estate tax laws, transfer taxes can be sharply reduced. A thorough discussion of the transfer tax reduction strategies is out of scope for this course, but a follow-up with your internal planning team, attorney, CFP® professional, or CPA is highly recommended. </p>
<p>Sadly, a common creditor is a spouse in a divorce proceeding.  FLPs can be effective against ex-spouses as creditors as well. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here to know more.</span></p>
<p>We close our discussion of this powerful asset protection tool with an emphasis on its reliability for planning purposes. There is a century1 of law supporting the design, operation, and protections inherent in the limited partnership. Virtually no other effective AP tool offers this level of reliability.</p>
<h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
<p>The FLP is an effective and reliable ownership form for clients willing to both respect the entity and transfer only appropriate assets to the FLP. A huge bonus is reliability of a century of law.</p>
<p>A significant caveat is the ownership of the general partner&rsquo;s interest. A general partner&rsquo;s personally-owned assets are subject to the claims of partnership creditors. Therefore, a protected form of property ownership should be used to own the general partnership interest. One candidate for ownership of the general partner&rsquo;s interest is the Limited Liability Company discussed immediately after the exercises that follow. </p>
