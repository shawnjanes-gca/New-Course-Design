  <p>A <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Legal Information Institute (LII) of Cornell University Law School defines a Joint Tenancy (with Right of Survivorship) as: “A type of shared ownership of property, where each owner has an undivided interest in the property.  This type of ownership creates a right of survivorship, which means that when one owner dies, the other owners absorb the deceased owner's interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, if A and B own a house as joint tenants, both have undivided ownership of the property and the full right to occupy and use all of it.  If A dies, B gets sole ownership of the house because of the right of survivorship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship</a> is a joint <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undivided Interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;undivided interest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is where each co-owner has an &lt;strong&gt;interest in the entire property&lt;/strong&gt;, not just ownership of a piece of the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If two individuals own an undivided interest in an acre of land, each owner has an ownership interest in the entire acre, rather than one owning the northern half and the other owning the southern half.  Each owner, therefore, has the right to make use of the entire acre, not just a piece of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">undivided</a> ownership of property between an unlimited number of persons who may or may not be related. This form of property ownership is characterized by key factors described in the chart below.</p>

    </thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Ownership Interests </strong></th>
      <td>The joint tenants must all have <strong><em>equal ownership</em></strong> <strong><em>interests</em></strong>. For example, a JTWROS with 20 joint tenants results in each joint tenant owning 5%.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Control</th>
      <td><p><strong>Lifetime</strong> - During life, each joint tenant generally has full access to and control over the property. Additionally, each joint tenant can usually gift or sell their interest in the property without permission of the other joint tenants. This may vary by state law.</p>
        <div class="example-box">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>Father opens a JTWROS bank account with his daughter and deposits $100,000 into the account. Daughter may generally withdraw the entire $100,000 without permission from Dad.</p>
        </div>

<p><strong>Death</strong> - your client loses testamentary control of the property: the property passes to the surviving joint tenants automatically by operation of law.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Taxes and Probate</strong></th>
      <td><p><strong>Gift Tax - </strong>Gifts of JTWROS interests may be subject to gift tax and/or generation-skipping transfer tax.</p>
      <p><strong>Estate Tax</strong> - The value of any JTWROS property owned by your client is included in his or her gross estate for estate tax purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>Income Tax</strong> - Income generated by the JTWROS is allocated equally among the joint tenants: a JTWROS with $1,000,000 in profits and with 10 joint tenants would result in each joint tenant including $100,000 in gross income.</p>
      <p><strong>Probate</strong> does not apply because the JTWROS property passed automatically, outside of the probate process, to the surviving joint tenants.</p></td>

  <h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
  <p>Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship provides little effective asset protection and may actually increase the risk of successful attack by creditors. Creditor risk varies proportionally with number of joint tenants; the greater the number of joint tenants the greater the risk of attack by their creditors. Some practitioners would argue this form provides even less asset protection that sole name or fee simple ownership.</p>
  <div class="example-box"> 
  <h3 style="color:red;">Caution</h3>
  <p>A common and potentially disastrous misconception is that property in a JTWROS is protected from the individual creditors of the joint tenants. <strong><em>The reality is that property held as JTWROS may be subject to attack by creditors of any one of the joint tenants!</em></strong><sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup></p>
  </div>
  <!-- example-box -->
  <p>How could that be? The reason is simply that because any one of the joint tenants may have access to and control over the entire JTWROS property, creditors of any one of the joint tenants may be granted the same access.</p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>A father opens a JTWROS bank account with his daughter and deposits $100,000 into the account. Daughter may withdraw the entire $100,000 without permission from Dad. Daughter has $100,000 in outstanding judgments from a jury award. In many states, the daughter&rsquo;s judgment creditor could generally sue for collection against the entire $100,000 in the bank account. </p>
