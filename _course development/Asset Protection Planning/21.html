  <p>Your clients may have heard the drumbeat promoting liability protection using corporations for decades. Yet corporations are primarily designed to protect personal assets from corporate, not personal, creditors. Consider the following before joining the drum line of supporters of the corporate form for AP:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal creditors may lay claim to any asset one owns personally, including shares in a corporation.</li>
    <li>Hence, transferring personally-owned assets to a corporation merely exposes those assets to additional threat from corporate creditors. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is a potential, though less than ideal, solution. Your client may choose to indirectly (instead of personally) own the shares.  What would that look like?  One merely titles the corporate shares in the name of an entity, such as a Limited Liability Company, Partnership, or Trust.  This approach solves one problem and creates at least one new one.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Problem solved</strong> - Because the shares are no longer owned personally by your client, a measure of asset protection is achieved through indirect entity ownership.</li>
    <li><strong>Problem created</strong> – This approach adds unnecessary complexity, cost, and administrative burden to the AP plan. Why not simply transfer the personally-owned assets to an LLC, Partnership, or specialized Trust? Remember that your client must be able to live the plan AND explain it to a judge!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If that were not enough, there may be increased income taxes from <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Taxation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Corporations come in two flavors - the C Corporation and the S Corporation.  In a C Corporation, the profits of the business are subject to corporate income taxes. When dividends are distributed to the shareholders, the dividends are also taxed to the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;S Corporations are not exposed to double taxation - their earnings flow through to the shareholders without corporate taxation. S Corporation earnings are only taxed to the shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">double taxation</a> and <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Holding Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to regular corporate income taxes, personal holding companies are subject to a penalty tax of 20% of earnings retained by the corporation. A personal holding company is a business that derives half or more of its income from investments (or other passive sources) and is owned by relatively small number of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">personal holding company</a> status.</p>
  <h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
  <p>Transferring personally-owned property to a corporation owned indirectly by your client may reduce the risk of losing the assets to personal creditors. The assets remain exposed to corporate creditors.</p>
  <p>Bottom line – As you will see subsequently in this course, there are simpler and more effective strategies to protect your client&rsquo;s assets.</p>
