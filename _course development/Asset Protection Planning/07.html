                <p>In deciding whether or not a fraudulent transfer has occurred, one of the factors taken into account by courts is whether or not the debtor (your client) &ldquo;transferred substantially all of [his or her] assets.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>The risk here is that the entire transfer can be voided (or reversed) because <em>all</em> assets were placed beyond the reach of creditors.</p>

                <p>Asset protection plans are generally tax neutral for U.S. citizens. Income and transfer taxes (gift, estate, generation-skipping transfer) will have to be paid when due, even if assets are transferred to <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Jurisdictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For most clients, the simple, tried, and true legal tools analyzed later in this course will more than suffice. For the ultra high net worth client, however, there are complex strategies available that involve trusts or other ownership forms outside of the United States. Even when a U.S. citizen&rsquo;s income flows from foreign (&ldquo;offshore&rdquo;) assets, a federal law (&lt;strong&gt;FATCA&lt;/strong&gt;) ensures that taxes are assessed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 2em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FATCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted in 2010 and ensures income tax compliance by U.S. citizens with offshore assets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One FATCA provision requires foreign financial institutions holding a U.S. citizen&rsquo;s assets to report the U.S. citizen&rsquo;s asset and income information to the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">foreign jurisdictions</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Question: What&rsquo;s worse than having no asset protection plan?</strong></p>
                <p>Attempting to hide one&rsquo;s assets to defraud a creditor (such as a former spouse or judgment creditor following a trial) is highly likely to backfire in a most unpleasant way.</p>
                <p><strong>Answer: Being caught hiding assets!</strong></p>
                <p>The consequences of a judge discovering one&rsquo;s attempt to hide assets include 1) the possibility of having the transfer reversed (voided), 2) the creditor gaining access to the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; assets, or 3) the possibility of jail time if the assets are not surrendered by your client. <span class="pageInstruction">Click <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14-Year Jail Term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Philadelphia attorney H.

                <p>There are two equally dangerous schools of thought as to the proper place for insurance in asset protection planning: 1) the cancellation of all insurance if you have an effective asset protection plan, and 2) purchasing insurance and ignoring the need for an asset protection plan.</p>
                <p>The most enlightened approach may be found within those two extremes and here is why:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Certain insurance policy exclusions or exceptions are either uninsurable or insurable only at extreme cost. If you are sued for an uninsured risk, your asset protection plan may be the only guardian keeping the financial wolves at bay </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>While insurance is far from perfect, it offers a vital benefit found nowhere else. The insurance company is obligated to pay for the legal costs of defending a claim and pay (or settle) judgments up to the policy limits. Remember that legal defense costs can approach $100,000 (or more). </li>
                  <li>The ideal asset protection plan generally includes the use of both insurance and asset protection strategies.              </li>
                </ul>

                <p>&ldquo;Expensive&rdquo; is a relative term. For example, &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; compared to what? In regards to asset protection, one must balance the expense of an asset protection plan against the potential loss of one&rsquo;s net worth.</p>
                <p>Top-notch legal talent costs money. The good news is that the largest cost is in the original design and implementation of the plan. In succeeding years, legal costs for maintenance of the plan tends to be minimal.</p>
                <p><span class="pageInstruction">Below is a famous quote from America’s pioneering astronaut that may give insight:</span></p>
                <div class="example-box"><p><strong>Quote from Astronaut John Glenn</strong></p>
                  <p>When asked how it felt to be sitting on what amounted to a massive controlled-burn bomb, John was asked how it felt to be sitting in the module during countdown.</p>
                  <p>He replied,<em> &ldquo;… I felt exactly how you would feel if you were getting ready to launch and knew you were sitting on top of two million parts -- all built by the lowest bidder on a government contract.&rdquo;</em></p>
                  <p>If you are sued, you want to be &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; in an asset protection plan crafted by the best asset protection attorney you can find.</p>
