<h2>Elements of an Effective Asset Protection Plan</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Asset protection (AP) plans follow the same imperatives as virtually any effective financial plan. We begin with client goals and then develop strategies to meet those goals.</p>
<p>The temptation is often to make AP plans overly complex. Like many temptations, this is a good one to resist. <strong><em>The most effective AP plan emphasizes the simplest tactics required to achieve client goals. </em></strong></p>
<p>How do you know when the plan is too complex?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your client cannot clearly and confidently explain the plan to a plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney (this could imply the plan is a sham to a judge).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your client struggles with &ldquo;living the plan.&rdquo; As but one example, if business assets are used to pay personal expenses from a business partnership, then the business purpose of the partnership may be challenged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of creating an effective AP plan must include an analysis of the elements summarized below. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click each element to learn more.</strong></p>

<p>No one hugs a porcupine. Why? The endeavor is fraught with risk yet offers no reward.

<p>Property owned in your client&rsquo;s name or property over which your client has complete control may not be protected from creditors. Hence, the key AP imperative is to move assets from an unprotected form of ownership to a protected form of ownership.</p>

<h4>Discourage Litigation</h4>
<p>The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorneys working on a contingent fee contract must generally secure an award or settlement to get paid.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An award or settlement must generally come from the defendant&rsquo;s assets if no insurance coverage applies. Even when coverage applies, the award may exceed the limits of your client&rsquo;s policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the client does not legally own assets or there exist significant legal barriers around the assets, a plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney may well choose not to invest his or her time into what could become a fruitless legal pursuit of your client.</p>

<h4>Empower Your Client</h4>
<p>The emotional stress of a lawsuit cannot always be measured in dollars. Litigation stress, such as in malpractice claims, can lead to depression, feelings of losing control, and the perception of helplessness.<sup>1</sup> Measurable costs include reduced productivity and legal fees.</p>
<p>An effective AP plan can reduce emotional stress by more equally balancing power between defendant and plaintiff. How is that accomplished?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The plaintiff must not only prove your client&rsquo;s liability, but must then also pursue assets guarded by an AP plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process may become just as daunting for the plaintiff as for the defendant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your client&rsquo;s AP plan may, therefore, lead to settlement of judgments for mere pennies on the dollar.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h4>Effective Against Most Claims</h4>
<p>Consider the case of the successful real estate magnate who established an effective AP plan to insulate himself from the possibility of future toxic waste claims.</p>
<p>The toxic waste claims never materialized, but another claim did. His wife filed for divorce and the divorce settlement was significantly reduced due to the strong nature of his AP plan.<sup>1</sup></p>
