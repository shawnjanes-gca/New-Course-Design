<p><strong><em>The foundation of property ownership begins with knowing the types of property.</em></strong></p>
<p>An asset&rsquo;s protection from creditors may depend substantially upon the type of property owned. For example, a judge may be more inclined to enforce a judgment against an individual&rsquo;s brokerage account than to force the sale of a married couple&rsquo;s personal residence to satisfy the husband&rsquo;s judgment creditors.</p>
<p>As you will learn later in this course, it not generally possible in some states to force the sale of a jointly-owned personal residence to enforce a judgment against an individual spouse.</p>
<p>There are only two broad types of property. <em><strong>All</strong></em> property is either "real property" or "personal property."</p>

<p>While all real property is tangible, personal property may be tangible or intangible as illustrated in the chart below.</p>

<h4>Discourage Litigation</h4>
<p>The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorneys working on a contingent fee contract must generally secure an award or settlement to get paid.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An award or settlement must generally come from the defendant&rsquo;s assets if no insurance coverage applies. Even when coverage applies, the award may exceed the limits of your client&rsquo;s policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the client does not legally own assets or there exist significant legal barriers around the assets, a plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney may well choose not to invest his or her time into what could become a fruitless legal pursuit of your client.</p>

<h4>Empower Your Client</h4>
<p>The emotional stress of a lawsuit cannot always be measured in dollars. Litigation stress, such as in malpractice claims, can lead to depression, feelings of losing control, and the perception of helplessness.<sup>1</sup> Measurable costs include reduced productivity and legal fees.</p>
<p>An effective AP plan can reduce emotional stress by more equally balancing power between defendant and plaintiff. How is that accomplished?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The plaintiff must not only prove your client&rsquo;s liability, but must then also pursue assets guarded by an AP plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process may become just as daunting for the plaintiff as for the defendant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your client&rsquo;s AP plan may, therefore, lead to settlement of judgments for mere pennies on the dollar.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h4>Effective Against Most Claims</h4>
<p>Consider the case of the successful real estate magnate who established an effective AP plan to insulate himself from the possibility of future toxic waste claims.</p>
<p>The toxic waste claims never materialized, but another claim did. His wife filed for divorce and the divorce settlement was significantly reduced due to the strong nature of his AP plan.<sup>1</sup></p>
