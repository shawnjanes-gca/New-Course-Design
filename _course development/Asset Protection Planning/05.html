  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Settlement Pressure</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Perhaps the greatest contributor to the rise of litigation is &ldquo;settlement pressure.&rdquo; The pressure to settle a lawsuit is so overwhelming that 95% of all lawsuits are settled before trial.<sup>1</sup> If you are a claimant, those are extremely good odds, virtually assuring you that you will have some level of success in bringing suit.</p>

                <p>When you hire a surgeon to operate, you pay a fee regardless of the outcome. When you hire an investment advisor, you generally pay the investment advisory fee even if your returns fall below your expectations. How about your income tax return? You pay your CPA even if you do not receive the anticipated refund.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>But you may hire an attorney on a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contingent Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Bar Association defines contingent fees thusly: &ldquo;If you win the case, the lawyer's fee comes out of the money awarded to you. If you lose, neither you nor the lawyer will get any money, but you will not be required to pay your attorney for the work done on the case.&rdquo;&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">contingent fee</a> basis and pay no attorney&rsquo;s fees unless you collect an award or settlement! You will generally have to pay court costs, such as filing fees, however. </li>
             
                  <li>Contingent fees have both supporters and critics. Supporters claim that these fee arrangements give the common man access to legal redress in the courts, while critics believe such fees increase frivolous litigation.<sup>2</sup></li>
                  <li>Clearly, not all lawsuits involving the use of contingent fees are frivolous. However, that knowledge is cold comfort to a client subjected to a frivolous lawsuit that was even partially enabled by contingent fees. </li>

                <p>Unlike the English legal system, the American legal system generally does not require the loser to pay the winner&rsquo;s legal fees. There are perfectly legitimate arguments on both sides, but the impact to your client may well be one of frivolous litigation because there is little to no cost to a plaintiff who loses a lawsuit. This factor may exacerbate the risk of litigation created by contingency fees.</p>

                <p>One litigation lender advertises the following:<strong></strong></p>

                <p>A famous old adage goes &ldquo;better the devil you know than the devil you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The suppliers to a shuttered steel mill in Texas would wholeheartedly agree with that admonition. They collectively paid over $90 million in settlements to avoid a trial even though their liability was tenuous at best. </li>
                  <li>The suppliers were sued because the defunct steel mill had no significant assets to go after. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>An excerpt from one of the plaintiff&rsquo;s negotiating a settlement follows: &ldquo;I heard that they were getting a suit up about stuff………so I wanted to get in on the party.&rdquo;</p>
                <div class="example-box"><h3>Details</h3>
                  <p>The Lone Star Steel mill shut down, putting some 3,000 employees out of work. Those 3,000 employees sued the suppliers to the steel mill for &ldquo;chemical AIDS&rdquo; caused by &ldquo;<strong>unspecified substances</strong>&rdquo; (this was the exact language of the charge).</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Even suppliers selling nothing more than felt-tip markers, folding tables, and hand soap were named in the lawsuit. </li>
                    <li>Texas Monthly reported that &ldquo;[John Doe], <strong>a healthy worker</strong> who received about $22,000 from settlements, stated &lsquo;I heard that they were getting a suit up about stuff that we had breathed out here at the plant, and I figured I had been out there thirty-seven years and I breathed about everything everybody else breathed, and so I wanted to get in on the party.&rsquo; &rdquo; </li>
                    <li>One of the other plaintiffs worked in a sterile environment in the plant for a mere three months in 1945, yet joined the lawsuit some 50 years after working there!</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Our purpose in this example is not to disparage any actual injuries or suffering of plant workers, but to illuminate a sobering risk. Not even suppliers to manufacturers are safe from liability claims.                </p>
