<p>In most states, a wide range of property types may be held in an FLP as denoted in the chart to the right.</p>
<p>However, not every asset should be transferred to FLP ownership as denoted below:</p>

<p>Taxes can be significantly reduced through the use of the FLP. Because the FLP is a &ldquo;<strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">flow-through</a></strong>&rdquo; entity for income tax purposes, partnership income is taxed only to the partners and the partnership itself generally pays no income taxes.</p>
<p>FLPs are a long-term favorite of estate planners as well. Through creative use of the limited partnership estate tax laws, <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s">transfer taxes</a></strong> can be sharply reduced. A thorough discussion of the transfer tax reduction strategies is out of scope for this course, but a follow-up with your internal planning team, attorney, CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>professional, or CPA is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Sadly, a common creditor is a spouse in a divorce proceeding. FLPs can be effective against ex-spouses as creditors as well. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> to know more</strong>.</p>
<p>We close our discussion of this powerful asset protection tool with an emphasis on its reliability for planning purposes. There is a century<sup>1</sup> of law supporting the design, operation, and protections inherent in the limited partnership. Virtually no other effective AP tool offers this level of reliability.</p>
<h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
<table style="width: 650px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p>The FLP is an effective and reliable ownership form for clients willing to both respect the entity and transfer only appropriate assets to the FLP. A huge bonus is reliability of a century of law.</p>
<p>A significant caveat is the ownership of the general partner&rsquo;s interest. A general partner&rsquo;s personally-owned assets are subject to the claims of partnership creditors. Therefore, a protected form of property ownership should be used to own the general partnership interest. One candidate for ownership of the general partner&rsquo;s interest is the Limited Liability Company discussed immediately after the exercises that follow.</p>

<h4>Flow-Through</h4>
<p>The IRS ignores the entity itself and taxes each partner on his or her share of partnership income. From an IRS perspective, the income flows through to the individual partners as if the partnership did not exist. Contrast this with the corporate form in which corporate profit is subject to corporate income tax and dividends are subject to taxation when received by the shareholders.</p>

<h4>Ex-Spouse as Creditor</h4>
<p>A limited partnership interest awarded to an ex-spouse as part of a divorce proceeding is the award of an illiquid asset. Because the asset may be restricted to ownership by family members (or ex-family members), it may be very difficult for the ex-spouse to sell the limited partnership interest. This dynamic may well open the door for your client to settle divorce claims at discounted values.</p>
