<p>There are two basic types of states<sup>1</sup> with respect to marital property ownership - common law property states and community property states. The distinction between these two types of states lies in the general presumption of ownership.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>common law (CL) property states</strong>, the general presumption for marital property ownership is that the purchaser of an asset may title that asset in any manner he or she chooses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>community property (CP) states</strong>, the general presumption for marital property ownership is that any property, including earnings of either spouse, coming into the community (the marriage) becomes community property. Some <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>exceptions</strong></a> apply.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This form of ownership is characterized by key factors described in the chart below.</p>

<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p><strong>Lifetime</strong> - The sale, gift, or encumbrance of community property generally requires permission of both spouses.</p>
<p><strong>Death</strong> - Your client retains testamentary control of the property; thus, the property passes according to the Last Will and Testament of the decedent spouse. This is a huge difference between JTWROS and TBE ownership forms. CP does NOT pass automatically to the surviving spouse.</p>

<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9"><strong>Taxes and Probate </strong></td>
<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p><strong>Gift Tax</strong> - A spouse changing separate property into community property makes a gift to his or her spouse. Such gifts are generally fully excluded from the gift tax as long as the donee spouse is a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p><strong>Estate Tax</strong> - One-half of the total value of CP owned by your client at his or death is included in his or her gross estate for estate tax purposes. However, 100% of the CP is <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">stepped-up in basis</a></strong> for income tax purposes. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Income Tax</strong> - Income generated by CP is allocated equally among the spouses.</p>
<p><strong>Probate</strong> - Any property disposed of by the decedent&rsquo;s Last Will and Testament must generally go through the probate process. Hence, the decedent&rsquo;s one-half of CP becomes a probate asset at death.</p>

<h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
<table style="width: 650px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p>A popular misconception is that all states protect CP from <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer4','','show')" href="#_s">separate</a></strong> creditors of the spouses. This misconception is the Achilles heel of many informal &ldquo;AP plans.&rdquo; The reality is sobering. Some state laws actually increase the risk of losing assets to creditors!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A number of states allow the creditors of an individual spouse to claim CP <strong>even if the debt was acquired before the marriage. </strong></em></li>
<li><em>Over one-half of the CP states allow a separate debt of one spouse, acquired during the marriage, to be satisfied from CP. </em></li>
<li><em>Still other states allow only </em><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer5','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>tort</strong></a><em> claims against CP. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, CP is not generally an effective AP strategy and may actually increase vulnerability to claims from separate creditors of the spouses.</p>

<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>The following property is separately owned by the spouses in a community property state:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Property acquired before the marriage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gifts and inheritances received during the marriage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal injury awards</p>

<li>
<p>Property acquired with separately-owned property</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property converted from community property to separate property by mutual agreement of the spouses</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Separate property must remain segregated from community property to maintain its separate status. Commingling separate property with community property may create the rebuttable presumption that the separate property is part of the community.</p>

<h4>Stepped-Up in Basis</h4>
<p>The tax value of an asset is referred to as its basis. When an asset is sold, taxable gain is calculated as sales price less basis (with some adjustments). <strong>Therefore, an increase in basis generally reduces income tax in a subsequent sale.</strong></p>
<p>When a decedent dies, his or her property may be eligible for an increase in income tax basis to fair market at death, as reported on the federal estate tax return. This process is referred to as a step-up in basis.</p>
