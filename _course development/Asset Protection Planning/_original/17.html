<p>A <strong><a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer1','','show')" href="#_s">Tenancy In Common</a></strong> is a joint undivided ownership of property between an unlimited number of persons who may or may not be related. This form of ownership appeals to clients seeking maximum control over a shared ownership interest during lifetime and at death - it is characterized by key factors described in the chart below.</p>

<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p>Each joint tenant owns a specified percentage of the TIC. Unequal ownership interests are allowed. The TIC is the only shared ownership form that permits unequal ownership interests. For example, one joint tenant in a TIC may own 7% while another owns 93%. Remember that all other shared ownership forms require equal ownership among the joint tenants.</p>

<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p><strong>Lifetime</strong> - The sale, gift, or encumbrance of TBE property is allowed without the consent of the other joint tenants.</p>
<p><strong>Death</strong> - Your client controls the disposition of property at death, generally through provisions in the Last Will and Testament. The property does NOT pass automatically to the surviving joint tenants at the death of a tenant.</p>

<p><strong>Gift Tax</strong> - Gifts of TIC interests may be subject to gift tax and/or generation-skipping transfer tax.</p>
<p><strong>Estate Tax</strong> - The value of any TIC property owned by your client is included in his or her gross estate for estate tax purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Income Tax</strong> - Income generated by the TIC is allocated based upon the ownership percentage of each of the joint tenants. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer3','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Probate</strong> - TIC property is part of the probate estate and is therefore fully subject to probate expenses and delays.</p>

<h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
<table style="width: 650px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p>Tenancy in Common is generally not an effective means of asset protection.</p>
<p>Creditors may wield relatively more power than the debtor (your client). Because the TIC can be impacted by a creditor of any one of the joint tenants, the risk of creditor attack multiplies as the number of joint tenants increases. Some practitioners would argue this form provides even less protection that sole name or fee simple ownership.</p>
<p>We will analyze creditor protection from this form with a case study on the following page.</p>

<h4>Tenancy in Common</h4>
<p>The Legal Information Institute (LII) of Cornell University Law School defines a Tenancy in Common as &ldquo;a type of shared ownership of property, where each owner owns a share of the property. These shares can be of unequal size, and can be freely transferred to other owners both during life and via a will. &nbsp;Even if owners own unequal shares, however, all owners have the right to occupy and use all of the property.&rdquo; <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example from the LII.</strong></p>
