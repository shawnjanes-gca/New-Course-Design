<p>Perfection can become the enemy of the effective. That idea has seldom been truer than in asset protection planning. Trying to protect the very last dollar of net worth can prove expensive, complex, and could very well backfire.</p>
<p>The ideal asset protection plan is the simplest plan that provides effective legal obstacles and impediments to judgment creditors. Such a plan should discourage litigation or incent reasonable settlement during litigation.</p>

<li>
<p>An effective AP plan must be clear enough to explain to a plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel before a judge. If your client cannot articulate why a domestic asset protection trust was used, then a judge may well regard the trust as a mere device to defraud creditors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your client has to live with the AP plan daily. Flying the family to Fiji on a purely personal vacation should never be funded from corporate, FLP, or LLC funds. To do so invites a judge to regard the entity as your client&rsquo;s alter ego and ignore the entity completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AP planning is effective and legal only against <em><strong>future creditors</strong></em>. Transferring assets to a protected form after the liability event occurs may only accomplish judicial antipathy and mistrust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transferring 100% of one&rsquo;s assets into a protective form even before a liability event may be subject to challenge of fraudulent transfer with respect to future creditors.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that the insights, opportunities, and risks shared in this lesson will help you inform your client&rsquo;s discussion with legal counsel. The ultimate goal of AP planning is peace of mind for your clients. Peace of mind may be enhanced by reducing the risk of losing net worth to judgment creditors in a litigious legal environment.</p>
