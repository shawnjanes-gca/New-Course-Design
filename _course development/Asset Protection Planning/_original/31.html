<li>Personal Injury (such as <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer5','','show')" href="#_s"><strong>slander and libel</strong></a>)</li>

<p>If this key policy were the subject of a text message, the message would read &ldquo;we <img src="greene/cprs_program/lesson_16/clip_image-24762.png" alt="" width="14" height="12" /> umbrella policies.&rdquo; Here are just a few of the powerful reasons to consider an umbrella policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-efficient</strong> - These policies are generally among the lowest cost liability policies available. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of each client, annual premium rates can be as low as $200 per $1 million of coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High policy limits</strong> - Coverage may generally be obtained by most clients for their entire net worth (recommended) or more to cover future earnings as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broader Coverage</strong> - Umbrella policies usually cover liabilities excluded from homeowners and personal auto policies such as slander, libel, or claims related to service as a volunteer Board member for a charity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, umbrella coverage is not all-inclusive. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer12','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for examples of potential exclusions from umbrella coverage. </strong></p>

<p>Noteworthy - Umbrella policies generally require significant underlying liability coverage (above state minimums) on both automobile and homeowners policies.</p>

<h3><a id="p7ABt1_4" href="javascript:;"><strong>Standard Directors and Officers Coverage (D &amp; O) </strong></a></h3>

<div id="p7ABw1_4">
<div id="p7ABc1_4" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>This coverage is a must for your clients in corporate, educational, and not-for-profit leadership roles. Simply put, D &amp; O policies cover liability resulting from management decisions that have adverse financial consequences. The coverage may exclude some bodily injury claims, property damage claims, and fraud.</p>
<p>If your client is in a senior leadership role, he or she should generally have D &amp; O insurance. But here&rsquo;s a <strong>huge caveat</strong> - your client&rsquo;s attorney should review the policy to confirm that your client, and not just the organization, is covered.</p>

<p>The multitude of policy types for differing liabilities can be confusing to clients. A quick example will underscore the point.</p>
<table style="width: 650px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9"><strong>Example</strong>
<p>Your clients, George and Martha, have a net worth of $15 million. They are doting grandparents of their sole grandchild, Sarah, age 17.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a recent trip to their beachfront condo overlooking Kaanapali Beach on Maui, Martha purchased a new jet ski for Sarah.</li>
<li>George assumed the jet ski was covered under their homeowners policy and believed he had two weeks to report the purchase to their insurance company. Coverage would then, he assumed, be automatic and retroactive to the purchase date.</li>
<li>Martha assumed the jet ski was covered automatically by their standard personal umbrella policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regretfully, Sara became distracted by the Maui firemen shooting their annual calendar on the beach and grazed a swimmer with the jet ski. As fate would have it, the swimmer was a surgeon and his operating hand was permanently damaged by the accident.</p>
<p>George and Martha were horrified to learn that the jet ski was not covered by liability insurance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their homeowners liability policy excluded watercraft with the horsepower of the jet ski.</li>
<li>Their standard personal umbrella policy excluded jet skis from coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>They should have purchased personal watercraft coverage for the jet ski and sought a rider or endorsement to add the jet ski to their umbrella policy.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><strong>Without an effective AP plan, the couple&rsquo;s entire net worth could be exposed to liability claims resulting from Sarah&rsquo;s accident. </strong></p>

<p>Liability insurance is a vital part of AP planning for the vast majority of clients. If nothing else, the insurance company generally pays for the legal defense costs of covered claims. Keep in mind that legal defense costs can exceed $100,000, as we revealed in the introduction to this lesson.</p>
<p>The type and amount of insurance coverage should be based upon a risk analysis by your client&rsquo;s Property and Casualty Agent in coordination with an experienced AP attorney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your analysis of these policy types will illustrate that insurance policies have gaps in coverage. Those gaps in coverage could represent sobering financial risks that may be managed by the other AP strategies covered in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
