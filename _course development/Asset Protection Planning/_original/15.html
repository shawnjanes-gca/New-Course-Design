Additionally, each joint tenant can usually gift or sell their interest in the property without permission of the other joint tenants. This may vary by state law.</p>

<p><strong>Gift Tax</strong> - Gifts of JTWROS interests may be subject to gift tax and/or generation-skipping transfer tax.</p>
<p><strong>Estate Tax</strong> - The value of any JTWROS property owned by your client is included in his or her gross estate for estate tax purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Income Tax</strong> - Income generated by the JTWROS is allocated equally among the joint tenants: a JTWROS with $1,000,000 in profits and with 10 joint tenants would result in each joint tenant including $100,000 in gross income.</p>
<p><strong>Probate</strong> does not apply because the JTWROS property passed automatically, outside of the probate process, to the surviving joint tenants.</p>

<h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#dbd9b9">
<p><strong>Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship</strong> provides little effective asset protection and <strong>may actually increase the risk of successful attack by creditors</strong>. Creditor risk varies proportionally with number of joint tenants; the greater the number of joint tenants the greater the risk of attack by their creditors. Some practitioners would argue this form provides even less asset protection that sole name or fee simple ownership.</p>
<p><img src="greene/cprs_program/lesson_16/clip_image-27973.png" alt="" width="51" height="60" align="left" hspace="12" />A common and potentially disastrous misconception is that property in a JTWROS is protected from the individual creditors of the joint tenants. The reality is that property held as JTWROS may be subject to attack by creditors of any one of the joint tenants!<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>How could that be? The reason is simply that because any one of the joint tenants may have access to and control over the entire JTWROS property, creditors of any one of the joint tenants may be granted the same access. <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer6','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example.</strong></p>

<h4>Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship</h4>
<p>The Legal Information Institute (LII) of Cornell University Law School defines a Joint Tenancy (with Right of Survivorship) as: &ldquo;A type of shared ownership of property, where each owner has an undivided interest in the property. &nbsp;This type of ownership creates a right of survivorship, which means that when one owner dies, the other owners absorb the deceased owner's interest.&rdquo; <strong style="color: #ff0000;">Click <a onclick="MM_showHideLayers('Layer2','','show')" href="#_s">here</a> for an example from the LII.</strong></p>
