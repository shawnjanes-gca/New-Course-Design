    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The preceding knowledge has hopefully equipped you to raise your client&rsquo;s awareness of unmanaged liability risks. Now, your role turns to empowering your client to have a meaningful dialog with his or her AP attorney. As a reminder, review your firm&rsquo;s policy and discuss that policy with your compliance department before discussing AP concepts with clients.</p>
  <p>Before considering AP strategies, your client needs to identify likely threats. Ironically, even management of likely threats is not always effective. Consider Frank and Jamie McCort of Los Angeles. Depending upon whom you believe, either Frank or both Frank and Jamie owned the Los Angeles Dodgers. An error in a prenuptial agreement opened the way for Jamie&rsquo;s legal team to claim co-ownership of the Dodgers in the couples&rsquo; infamous divorce.</p>
  <p>A record-setting $20 million in legal fees were expended and Frank ultimately settled with Jamie for a reported $130 million. What is the moral of the story?  Had Frank developed an effective AP plan before marriage, then the settlement, not to mention the stress of the bitter divorce struggle, may have been far less.</p>

                <p>Your client arrives at this floor if there remains significant unmanaged risk after liability insurance is purchased.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Many clients will find the relative simplicity and strength of using the right protective form of property ownership sufficient to meet their AP needs.</em></strong></p>
                <p>First, let us remind you of what is generally ineffective. You were trained to recognize the lack of meaningful asset protection in many of the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popular Ownership Forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Sole Name (personal property) and Fee Simple (real property)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Joint Tenancy With Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tenancy By The Entirety (TBE)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tenants In Common (TIC)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Community Property (CP)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In fact, JTWROS and TIC forms can actually lead to increased liability risks from creditors (resulting from creditors of other joint tenants) while TBE and CP do little or nothing to safeguard assets.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">popular ownership forms</a>.</p>
                <p>The remaining unmanaged risk as we left the second floor can frequently be addressed through the use of a Family Limited Partnership (FLP) or a Limited Liability Company (LLC). <strong><em>The FLP strategy, in particular, is reliable because of its 100-year statutory and case law history.</em></strong></p>
                <p>To address the liability risk to the general partner (GP) in the FLP, consider owning the GP&rsquo;s interest in an LLC.</p>
                <p>The serious hurdle presented to creditors by the <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charging Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An order from the court assigning the debtor&rsquo;s future distributions from the partnership (or LLC) to the judgment creditor is referred to as a charging order.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">charging order</a> relative to FLPs and LLCs is generally an deterrent to litigation and/or incentive for early and inexpensive settlement.</p>
                <p>For even more protection, consider <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separating Businesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A single LLC or FLP would not generally be appropriate to own both low-risk businesses (managing family wealth) and high-risk businesses (a manufacturing firm using toxic chemicals). Far better to separate these businesses into separate entities so that liability from the high-risk business does not threaten assets in the low-risk business.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clients with numerous businesses may be attracted to the &lt;strong&gt;holding company&lt;/strong&gt; to manage the separate companies for administrative purposes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dotted #E0EAF1;padding: 1em;margin: 1em 2em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;USLegal.com defines a holding company as &ldquo;a…… company, usually a corporation, which is created to own the stock of other corporations, often using the stock holdings to control the management and policies of all of them.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Certain types of holding companies can cause increased taxes. Consult with AP legal counsel, a CPA, and/or CFP® Certificant when considering the use of a holding company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Creating separate entities or transferring existing assets into different entities should be considered only with the advice of a CPA, CFP® professional, and AP planning attorney.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">separating businesses</a> from each other to limit liability.</p>
                <p>While the use of the Corporation holds allure for many clients, the <a href="#" title=" &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitfalls of the Corporate Form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Personal creditors may lay claim to any asset one owns personally, including shares in a corporation.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Transferring personally-owned assets to a corporation merely exposes those assets to a new threat from corporate creditors. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Earnings are taxed twice in C Corporations (once to the entity and again when dividends are paid to shareholders)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;S Corporations avoid double taxation, but prohibit FLPs and LLCs from owning shares.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4">pitfalls</a> of this ownership form may reduce its efficacy as effective AP.</p>

                <p>There will be clients who seek even more AP than the 3rd floor offers. In the spirit of full disclosure, we have erred on the side of caution in our presentation of the 4th floor.</p>
                <p>Advisors encouraging the formation of Asset Protection Trusts would be well-served by refraining from an unqualified endorsement while referring the discussion to experienced AP planning attorneys.</p>
                <p>Asset protection trusts are established under the laws of one of the states in the U.S. (Domestic Assets Protection Trust or DAPT) or in an international jurisdiction (International Asset Protection Trusts or IAPTs). We will discuss DAPTs first.</p>
                <p>DAPTs may be appealing but can be fraught with risks, such as <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Case Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;DAPT legislation was first passed by Alaska in 1997. Case law is relatively thin. Hence, this form of asset protection lacks the legal reliability of the FLP and LLC.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5">lack of case law</a> and <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competing States Agendas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The well-respected American College of Trust and Estate Council (ACTEC) advises that “if implemented correctly, the DAPT approach may be used successfully by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;residents of states with DAPT statutes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what if a resident of a state with no DAPT statute wishes to create a DAPT? And what if South Dakota has better DAPT creditor protection than Delaware? Can a person pick and choose which DAPT state statute to use without regard to his or her state of residence?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In large measure, this remains an unsettled legal issue in many states. In effect, the issue is the potential conflict of law when residents of State A use DAPT statues of State B to create DAPTs. ACTEC opines that “unless the resident’s state has ‘a strong public policy’ against DAPTs, then the likelihood [not certainty] is that the DAPT will be effective if implemented correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;footer&gt;            &lt;div class=&quot;footertext&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;!-- footertext --&gt;            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ACTEC Comparison of the Domestic Asset Protection Trust Statues, Updated through April 2014, edited by David G. Shaftel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;/footer&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_6">competing states agendas</a>.</p>
                <p>An International Asset Protection Trust (IAPT) is a trust established under the laws of another country.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>These trusts offer the promise of increased control to your client (the settlor). </li>
                  <li>This added control stems from, among other things, relaxed self-settled rules in which the settlor of the trust may become the beneficiary without an elaborate <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;control structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;in DAPTs frequently requires an independent trustee with sole discretion in making distributions to the settlor.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_7">control structure</a> in place. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>While IAPTs can be effective, remember that while the money may be in the Cook Islands, your client may reside in the U.S. and could be jailed for ignoring a judge&rsquo;s <a href="#" title=" &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repatriation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repatriation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the return of assets to the U.S. from an international jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_8">repatriation</a> order.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Remember that H. Beatty Chadwick served 14 years in prison under a contempt of court order for refusing to repatriate $2.5 in international accounts. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>IAPTs are subject to fraudulent transfer rules, just as any other AP plan.</p>
