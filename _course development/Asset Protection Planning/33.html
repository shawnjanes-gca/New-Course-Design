    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The preceding knowledge has hopefully equipped you to raise your client&rsquo;s awareness of unmanaged liability risks. Now, your role turns to empowering your client to have a meaningful dialog with his or her AP attorney. As a reminder, review your firm&rsquo;s policy and discuss that policy with your compliance department before discussing AP concepts with clients.</p>
  <p>Before considering AP strategies, your client needs to identify likely threats. Ironically, even management of likely threats is not always effective. Consider Frank and Jamie McCort of Los Angeles. Depending upon whom you believe, either Frank or both Frank and Jamie owned the Los Angeles Dodgers. An error in a prenuptial agreement opened the way for Jamie&rsquo;s legal team to claim co-ownership of the Dodgers in the couples&rsquo; infamous divorce.</p>
  <p>A record-setting $20 million in legal fees were expended and Frank ultimately settled with Jamie for a reported $130 million. What is the moral of the story?  Had Frank developed an effective AP plan before marriage, then the settlement, not to mention the stress of the bitter divorce struggle, may have been far less.</p>

                <p>The process of building the right AP plan for your client can be compared to an elevator. We begin at the ground floor and rise as high as needed to reach the destination.</p>
                <p>Before punching the button for the first floor, <strong><em>remember that no transfer of assets to a protected form after the liability event has occurred is immune from challenge as a fraudulent transfer!</em></strong></p>

                <ul>
                  <li>State and federal law provide exemptions from bankruptcy creditors and nonbankruptcy creditors. </li>
                  <li>Generally, these exemptions are provided without cost. However, be sure your client has taken affirmative steps where needed to obtain the exemption, such as filing for the Homestead Exemption.</li>
                  <li>Remember that exemption against bankruptcy creditors frequently differs from exemption against nonbankruptcy creditors.              </li>

                <p>Your client now assesses any risks not covered by exemptions. These risks can include divorce risk, professional liability risk, business risk, and other risks. To the extent these risks are insurable, appropriate coverage should be purchased.</p>
                <p>You learned that liability insurance, while vital, is no panacea. There will be policy limits and exclusions to manage.</p>

                <p>Your client arrives at this floor if there remains significant unmanaged risk after liability insurance is purchased.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Many clients will find the relative simplicity and strength of using the right protective form of property ownership sufficient to meet their AP needs.</em></strong></p>
                <p>First, let us remind you of what is generally ineffective. You were trained to recognize the lack of meaningful asset protection in many of the popular ownership forms.</p>
                <p>The remaining unmanaged risk as we left the second floor can frequently be addressed through the use of a Family Limited Partnership (FLP) or a Limited Liability Company (LLC). <strong><em>The FLP strategy, in particular, is reliable because of its 100-year statutory and case law history.</em></strong></p>
                <p>To address the liability risk to the general partner (GP) in the FLP, consider owning the GP&rsquo;s interest in an LLC.</p>
                <p>The serious hurdle presented to creditors by the charging order relative to FLPs and LLCs is generally an deterrent to litigation and/or incentive for early and inexpensive settlement.</p>
                <p>For even more protection, consider separating businesses from each other to limit liability.</p>
                <p>While the use of the Corporation holds allure for many clients, the pitfalls of this ownership form may reduce its efficacy as effective AP.</p>

                <p>There will be clients who seek even more AP than the 3rd floor offers. In the spirit of full disclosure, we have erred on the side of caution in our presentation of the 4th floor.</p>
                <p>Advisors encouraging the formation of Asset Protection Trusts would be well-served by refraining from an unqualified endorsement while referring the discussion to experienced AP planning attorneys.</p>
                <p>Asset protection trusts are established under the laws of one of the states in the U.S. (Domestic Assets Protection Trust or DAPT) or in an international jurisdiction (International Asset Protection Trusts or IAPTs). We will discuss DAPTs first.</p>
                <p>DAPTs may be appealing but can be fraught with risks, such as lack of case law and competing states agendas.</p>
                <p>An International Asset Protection Trust (IAPT) is a trust established under the laws of another country.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>These trusts offer the promise of increased control to your client (the settlor). </li>
                  <li>This added control stems from, among other things, relaxed self-settled rules in which the settlor of the trust may become the beneficiary without an elaborate control structure in place. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>While IAPTs can be effective, remember that while the money may be in the Cook Islands, your client may reside in the U.S. and could be jailed for ignoring a judge&rsquo;s repatriation order.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Remember that H. Beatty Chadwick served 14 years in prison under a contempt of court order for refusing to repatriate $2.5 in international accounts. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>IAPTs are subject to fraudulent transfer rules, just as any other AP plan.</p>
