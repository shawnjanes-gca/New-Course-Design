  <p>A partnership consists of two or more persons (or entities) engaged in a <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Partnerships require a valid business purpose. Among the purposes deemed a valid business purpose are centralized management of family assets, income tax management, and a host of other rationales.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">business</a>. All partnerships must have at least one <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The general partner(s) manage the partnership. General partners are personally liable for the claims against the partnership. Therefore, a general partner&rsquo;s personally-owned assets may be exposed to the claims of partnership creditors.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">general partner</a>. Partnerships containing one or more <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited partners&lt;/strong&gt; have no management power in a partnership; they are merely investors in the partnership. The liability of a limited partner is usually limited to his or her investment in the partnership. Happily, a limited partner&rsquo;s personally-owned assets are not usually exposed to the claims of partnership creditors.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">limited partners</a> are referred to as limited partnerships. Limited partnerships in which only family members are allowed to own partnership interests are referred to as Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs).</p>
  <p>The beauty of the FLP lies in its ability to give your client significant control as a general partner, while also providing significant asset protection. <strong><em>This is the first property ownership form studied that features control and asset protection simultaneously.</em></strong> The chart below analyzes these features. <span class="pageInstruction">Click on each feature to learn more.</span></p>

              <p>Partnerships enjoy a compelling legal protection. A judgment creditor of an individual partner may not seize partnership assets to collect on the judgment. Remember that judgment creditors can generally seize assets from the property ownership forms studied previously in this course.</p>

              <p>A <em><strong>charging order</strong></em> (defined below) generally prevents a judgment creditor from gaining control of the partnership or seizing partnership assets. But how then can a judgment creditor enforce a judgment?</p>
                <p>The remedy (in most states) is an order from the court assigning the partner&rsquo;s (debtor&rsquo;s) future distributions from the partnership to the judgment creditor.</p>
                <p>Such an order is referred to as a charging order. Sounds ominous, right? But consider that a &ldquo;charging order does not entitle the creditor to accelerate any distributions or to otherwise interfere with the management and activities of the limited partnership.&rdquo;<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup></p>

              <p>The judgment creditor, charging order in hand, awaits distributions from the FLP. However, the general partner controls distributions from the FLP, not the judgment creditor. Distributions can merely be suspended (subject to state law) until a settlement with the judgment creditor is reached.</p>

                <p>Some states permit foreclosure upon the debtor partner&rsquo;s interest in the partnership as an alternate remedy to the charging order. In such states, the debtor&rsquo;s negotiating position may be diminished yet generally remains significant.</p>

                <p>Based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the IRS<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup> may find that the judgment creditor is an assignee of partnership profits. Since partnership profits are generally taxed to the partners whether distributions of profits are made or not, the judgment creditor may find themselves paying income tax on a judgment they have not collected. This may add one more chip to the partner&rsquo;s negotiating position in reaching a settlement.</p>

               <p>A client holding a general partnership interest has theoretically unlimited liability to creditors of the partnership itself. One solution to this serious risk is to have a partner own the general partnership interest as a limited liability company or corporation.  Limited Liability Companies will be discussed subsequently.</p>

    <p>The significant protections afforded by the FLP form may be lost completely by clients who fail to respect the FLP as a separate and distinct entity. For example, any of the following actions by a partner may cause a court to find the FLP was a mere sham and never existed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Purchasing personal items or personal travel using partnership assets</li>
      <li>Signing partnership contracts as an individual instead of as a general partner of the partnership</li>
      <li>Failure to hold partnership meetings as required by state law</li>
