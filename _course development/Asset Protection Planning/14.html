  <p>The most complete form of property ownership is individual ownership. This form is characterized by the key factors in the chart below.</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
    <caption>
    <strong>INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP</strong>
    </caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col"><strong>Factor</strong></th>
        <th scope="col"><strong>Explanation</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Ownership Interest</strong></th>
      <td>The owner has complete control of the property subject only to law, such as zoning ordinances over real property.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Control</strong></th>
      <td><p><strong>Lifetime</strong> - During life, the owner may sell, gift, or encumber the property without anyone else&rsquo;s permission.</p>
      <p><strong>Death</strong> - your client retains testamentary control of the property: at the owner&rsquo;s death, the property passes to whomever the decedent chose in his or her Last Will and Testament.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Taxes and Probate</strong></th>
      <td><p><strong>Gift Tax - </strong>Gifts may be subject to gift tax and/or generation-skipping transfer tax.</p>
      <p><strong>Estate Tax</strong> - The value of the property is included in the decedent&rsquo;s gross estate for estate tax purposes. </p>
      <p><strong>Income Tax</strong> – All income generated by the property is included in the owner&rsquo;s gross income.</p>
      <p>Probate – The property is subject to the probate process.</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Sole name ownership</em></strong> provides the owner with the highest degree of control over the property. Generally, the more control retained by the owner, then the more vulnerable the asset becomes to creditors. Creditor protection is, therefore, not achieved with individual ownership.</p>
