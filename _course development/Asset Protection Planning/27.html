  </h1>
  <p>A <strong><em>Domestic Asset Protection Trust</em></strong> (DAPT) is an Irrevocable Trust created under the laws of one of the states. While an entire course could be written around DAPTs, we have distilled many of the key factors for your review in this brief discussion. Be aware that state law varies significantly and the scope of this course does not permit a review of all permutations of the DAPT across the states.</p>
  <p>We begin by dispelling a dangerous DAPT misconception.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conventional wisdom would have us believe that assets owned by any Irrevocable Trust are immune from attack by creditors.  </li>
    <li> While seductive, this is simply not the case under the laws of most states when the trust is &ldquo;self-settled.&rdquo; A self-settled trust is a trust for which the settlor is a primary beneficiary. <span class="pageInstruction">Click here for an example.</span></li>
  </ul>
 
  <p>A minority of the states permit a specialized form of Irrevocable Trust called a Domestic Asset Protection Trust. While state law varies, DAPTs are usually characterized by the factors in the table below.</p>

                <p>Even in DAPT states, the settlor is not allowed unfettered access to trust assets. The legal mechanisms used to limit access include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Spendthrift Provision</strong> - The spendthrift provision prevents the settlor and the settlor&rsquo;s creditors from accessing trust assets by specifically limiting the settlor&rsquo;s rights to trust assets. </li>
                  <li><strong>Independent Trustee</strong> – The Trustee must be independent of the settlor and not subject to the settlor&rsquo;s control. The Trustee should have absolute discretion over the timing and amount of distributions to the settlor as beneficiary.              </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The DAPT is not designed to protect assets from current creditors and is intended only to protect assets from future creditors. Generally, assets transferred to a DAPT to attempt protection against current creditors will be voidable (reversible).  See also the &ldquo;Look Back Period&rdquo; discussion below.</p>

                <p>A person&rsquo;s creditors have a limited time to contest a transfer of assets to a DAPT or file a claim against trust assets. This contestability period, legally referred to as the statute of limitations, varies significantly by state and by creditor type.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The statute of limitations for future creditors ranges from 0 years to 4 years </li>
                  <li>The statute of limitations for current creditors ranges from 1-½ years to 5 years. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Assets are generally protected from the settlor&rsquo;s creditors when the contestability period expires without a contest by the settlor&rsquo;s creditors.</p>

                <p><strong>Alimony and Child Support</strong> - A number of the DAPT states allow alimony and child support claims against trust assets without a time limit.  Some states do not. Still other states allow claims only if alimony and child support were payable at the time the settlor&rsquo;s assets were transferred to the DAPT.</p>
                <p><strong>Federal Bankruptcy</strong> – Federal statutes permit federal bankruptcy creditors to claim DAPT assets for ten years after the settlor transfers assets to the trust.</p>

                <p>Arguably, the ideal use of a state&rsquo;s DAPT statutes is by a resident of that state.<sup>1</sup> The legal issue in play here is whether or not a resident of State A can create an effective DAPT in State B. At its core, the question is whether or not State B&rsquo;s statutes will apply to residents of State A. This is an evolving area of DAPT law.</p>

  <p>Income tax management is not usually the primary motivator for settling a DAPT. However, it should be noted that a number of DAPT states exempt trust income from state income tax.</p>
  <h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
  <p>DAPTs hold out great promise on the surface, yet the relative lack of significant case law should compel thorough due diligence. While DAPTs may have a place in an AP plan, it may be wise to avoid putting all of the AP eggs into this one basket.</p>
  <p>One approach worth discussion with legal counsel is to transfer an LLC to a DAPT. This approach would establish an additional legal hurdle without relying exclusively on the DAPT statutes.</p>
