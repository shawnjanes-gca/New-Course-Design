  </h1>
  <p>A Tenancy by the Entirety (TBE) can be viewed as a JTWROS-like form of ownership reserved exclusively for spouses. Only spouses may title property in a TBE. Each spouse owns a joint undivided interest in the property. Not all states permit this form of property ownership. Among those states allowing TBE, this form of property ownership is generally characterized by key factors described in the chart below.</p>

      <p>Only real property can generally be owned and some states limit the type of property to only a personal residence. </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Control</strong></th>
      <td><p><strong>Lifetime</strong> - The sale, gift, or encumbrance of TBE property is generally allowed only with the consent of the other spouse.</p>
      <p><strong>Death</strong> - Your client loses testamentary control of the property: the property passes to the surviving spouse (joint tenant) automatically by operation of law.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Taxes and Probate</strong></th>
      <td><p><strong>Gift Tax - </strong>Gifts of TBE interests to a U.S. citizen spouse are not generally subject to gift tax and/or generation-skipping transfer tax.</p>
      <p><strong>Estate Tax</strong> - The value of any TBE property owned by your client is included in his or her gross estate for estate tax purposes. Because the property must transfer to the surviving spouse, no estate taxes are generally due because of the unlimited marital deduction from estate taxes.</p>
      <p><strong>Income Tax</strong> - Income generated by the TBE is allocated equally between the spouses.</p>
      <p><strong>Probate</strong> does not apply because the TBE property passes automatically, outside of the probate process, to the surviving spouse.</p></td>
    </tr>

  <h3>Asset Protection Verdict</h3>
  <p>This form of ownership does provide a modicum of asset protection. Normally, only joint creditors of the couple may successfully attack TBE property. Individual creditors of the individual spouses are usually unable to reach TBE property. Some states may even protect a personal residence from joint creditors (exceptions apply).</p>
  <p>Thus, the TBE form, if available, is marginally more effective against certain creditors than the JTWROS form. Noteworthy, however:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This form does nothing to insulate a client from divorce claims.</li>
    <li>Not all states permit this form. </li>
    <li>Even among states permitting TBE, the type of property allowed is often severely restricted.</li>
  </ul>
<strong><em>Bottom line - this form of property ownership should be evaluated but may not be appropriate as the cornerstone of an AP plan.</em></strong></div>
