                <p>Alan&rsquo;s creditors may, in many states, request the forced sale of the apartment building to satisfy Alan&rsquo;s unpaid debts. This process may be referred to as a foreclosure. Consequently, you may lose ownership of the apartment building although you will receive 75% of the proceeds of the forced sale. Such forced sales may not always yield the highest sales price.</p>
