  <p>Based on the information you gather on the interest and dividend section of the tax return, it is possible to identify a preliminary asset allocation.  For example, on the previous page we provide illustrations for bonds and stocks that would provide the preliminary asset allocation (below).</p>
  <table id="tableAlignLeft">
   
    
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Taxable Bonds</th>
        <td>$418,000</td>
    	<td>33%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Tax-free Bonds</th>
      <td>$250,000</td>
      <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <th scope="row">Stocks</th>
      <td>$600,000</td>

  <p>As we continue through the return, we will point out other sections of the return that will provide additional information regarding investments.</p>
  <p>Altogether, this investment information will provide you with sufficient information to initiate an informed investment discussion with the client.  During the course of that discussion, you can ask fact-finding questions that will clarify your understanding and help you determine potential needs.  You will also have opportunities to ask open-ended questions that help raise doubt in the client's mind about his or her current situation, thereby helping the client see the shortcomings that you find in the current portfolio and foster interest in solutions you can offer.</p>
  <p>Here are some key questions to consider asking.  Note that we have deliberately positioned some of these questions to place responsibility on the current advisor, rather than running the risk of embarrassing the client.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This question opens up a general discussion of the investment portfolio, allowing you to gain insight into the client's needs, objectives, and concerns, while also allowing you to ask further fact-finding questions like:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>Who do you rely on for      investment advice?</li>
                <li>What are your short-term      and long-term financial needs?</li>
                <li>How much income must your      investments generate to meet your current needs?</li>
                <li>What are the specific      holdings in your portfolio?</li>
                <li>How were these investments      selected?</li>
                <li>What do you value in your      relationships with your current investment manager(s)?</li>
                <li>What changes would you      make in these relationships?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This discussion will generally shed light on whether or not the invested assets are properly allocated, adequately diversified, and at the proper level of risk.  As these opportunities present themselves, you can further develop the conversation by asking some doubt-raising questions like:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>How has your advisor      worked with you to establish clearly defined investment objectives?</li>
                <li>How has your advisor      worked with you to select investments that are appropriate for your      objectives?</li>
              </ul>
Such doubt-raising questions will help the client recognize a need that may seem obvious to you, and incline the client to be interested in solutions you may offer.            </div>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> As you learn more about the client's needs and objectives, it may become apparent that the asset allocation is inappropriate.  This is an excellent doubt-raising question by which you can introduce a discussion regarding asset allocation.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Municipal bonds generally yield an interest rate below corporate bond rates.  Yet, due to the tax-free nature of many of these bonds, tax savings can at times more than compensate for the lost yield.  If a client is in a lower tax bracket, but holding municipal bonds, then the client is not being adequately compensated for the lower yield.  Similarly, if a client is in a higher tax bracket, but holding taxable bonds, then the client's after-tax income can be increased through a shift to municipal bonds.</p>
               <p>To identify what is appropriate for your client, you need to know the client's marginal tax rate.  This can be found by looking at the back of Form 1040 to find the client's taxable income and then locating that income on a tax rate schedule.</p><p><strong>Example.</strong>  Upon examining the 2016 return of a married couple filing jointly, you learn that the taxable income is $250,000. Locating this income on the following rate table reveals that the marginal bracket is 33%.</p><br />

                  <p>By analyzing the after-tax return of taxable and tax-free investments at a 33% marginal bracket, you can make the determination as to whether a shift in the bond portfolio is appropriate and whether or not this doubt-raising question should be asked.</p>            </div>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Often, you will discover that there is no clear process at work in selecting (or selling) securities, resulting in emotional decision-making that leads to sub-par performance.  If the client is unable to clearly articulate the process their current advisor(s) uses to buy and sell securities in the portfolio, they need to talk with you and members of your team further.  </p>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It is very common that individuals will either have much of their portfolio invested in a few securities (lack of diversification) or too many funds and/or securities in their portfolio (over-diversification).  Asking this question will identify whether or not the client is actively managing this important issue.  If they cannot effectively answer the question, it is probably in their best interest that you and your team engage in a review of their portfolio to ensure it is in fact properly diversified.</p>
