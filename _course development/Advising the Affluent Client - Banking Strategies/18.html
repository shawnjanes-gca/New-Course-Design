  <p>As discussed previously in this course, business owners represent a highly attractive segment of the affluent market due to their vast array of both personal and business planning needs. However, business owners are typically very busy people who too often set aside little time to ensure their financial affairs are in order.  By analyzing Schedule C of the tax return, you can identify if in fact the individual owns a business as well as other vital information that will enable you to more effectively engage the client in a targeted and relevant conversation.  Let's look at some of the key information that can be gleaned from this section of the return.</p>
  <p>Business income is reported on line 12 of Form 1040.</p>
  <p><img src="greene/aac_banking_strategies/images/2014 - Form 1040-Page 1 - Business Banking Opportunities.jpg" width="808" height="48" alt=""/></p>
  <p>The business income detail can be found on Schedule C, a copy of which can be clicking <a href="greene/aac_banking_strategies/2015 Schedule C Form 1040.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>For our purposes, do not be overly concerned with understanding everything you see on Schedule C.  Think of it is a place where you can identify what the client is interested in or what the client is familiar with.  People generally like to talk about themselves, particularly if they enjoy their profession.  These discussions can help create common ground between you and the client.</p>
  <p>As you review the schedule, here are some questions to keep in mind.</p>

              <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Take a closer look at the expenses in Part II of the Schedule.  In particular, look at the ratio of expenses to income.  Some business owners can be extremely aggressive in finding expenses that can be deducted.  If this ratio is high, then you can be pretty sure that the client will be equally aggressive regarding investments in the stock market.   </p>

            <div class="p7ap3-col-wrapper no-columns">
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Identify potential capital needs for the business by asking questions such as:</p>

                <li>How are your current loans      / lines of credit presently structured?</li>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Businesses obviously have core banking needs, including business banking and checking accounts as well as cash management strategies.  Identify opportunities by asking questions such as:</p>

                <li>Who do      you bank with currently?</li>
                <li>What      are the annual revenues of the business?</li>
