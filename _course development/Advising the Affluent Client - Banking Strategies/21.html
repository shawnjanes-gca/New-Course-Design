<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>In recent years, greater scrutiny has been focused on Boards of publicly traded companies. As such, a director is held to a higher standard of performance and an individual holding such a position will spend more time now than someone in such a position would have spent five years ago. Since these positions are more time-consuming and carry a much greater likelihood of public criticism, directors are more carefully chosen and are more thoughtful in acceptance. If a client is a current board member, it tells the consultant that the client is serious about the business affiliation and directorship duties.</p>

<div class="p7GPcontent">
<p>Trustee fees generally indicate a level of trust that the client enjoys within the family or close friends. Since the job of trustee is not subject to public scrutiny, it is sometimes a thankless job. Furthermore, the duties that accompany the fees are often unpleasant and can be quite time consuming. You may be able to offer professional services to assist the client in fulfilling the trustee duties.</p>
<p>The key to suggesting assistance is to find out how comfortable the client is with the duties that accompany the trustee title. It is also possible that the client has never seriously considered the liability associated with acting as trustee.</p>
<p>Begin by asking some fact-based questions. These will help you surface potential needs.<strong></strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>When was the trust created?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did the trust come about (due to death or some other event)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are the beneficiaries?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the size of the trust?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can the client name a successor trustee?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the document say about the client's power to name a co-trustee or an investment agent?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a clearer picture of the nature of the trust, asking more open ended, doubt-raising questions may introduce opportunities for you to provide assistance. Consider the following examples:<strong></strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>How do you feel about the risks associated with acting as trustee?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How have you balanced your desire to have close family relations against the risk that your decisions as trustee could be divisive (if the beneficiaries are family members)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
