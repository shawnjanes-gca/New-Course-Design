  </h1>
  <p>What are "below the line" deductions?  These are deductions most commonly referred to as itemized deductions, by which AGI is adjusted to derive taxable income.  These deductions are made up of medical expenses, taxes, interest, charitable contributions, casualty losses and miscellaneous deductions.  While itemized deductions are reported on a single line of the return, the details behind the deductions are shown on <strong>Schedule A</strong>, which shall be examined more closely below.</p>

It is difficult to receive a tax benefit from medical expenses due to a “floor” the IRS requires filers to meet prior to any benefit.  Unless the client is paying for nursing home expenses or has experienced a catastrophic medical event, most taxpayers are unable to gain benefit from medical expenses.  Thus, an entry in this area indicates long-term medical care costs or a one-time event.  Inquiry should be made to identify any possible implications regarding estate planning needs.

    <area shape="rect" coords="1,202,794,331" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;strong&gt;2  - Taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Yes, taxes are deductible.   Which ones?  State income tax  payments, real estate taxes, and personal property taxes are most common in  this area.  You can learn several things  from this section:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can identify the person&rsquo;s home state based on the state income tax payments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The payment of real estate taxes indicates a possible mortgage opportunity.  In fact, further discussion about what type of property is generating the real estate taxes could reveal multiple properties, such as a main home and a vacation property, all mortgage opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The presence of state income taxes serves as a reminder to consider both Federal and State taxes when examining the tax effectiveness of investments." >
    <area shape="rect" coords="0,330,794,507" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;strong&gt;3 – Interest Expense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The presence of interest expense should always lead to a discussion of mortgage products.  In doing so, you should be mindful of the use of the proceeds and the ability to deduct the interest expense.  Even though mortgage interest is reported on a tax return, it doesn’t mean it is always deductible.  The general rules for deducting interest expense take into consideration the purpose of the loan.  If the proceeds of the loan are used for personal expenses, the interest is generally not deductible.  The exception to the rule is a mortgage on the main home.  If the main home secures the loan, then the interest is deductible.  Most people think of the exception as the general rule because they have a mortgage on their home. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Investment interest is also reported in this section.  The rules regarding the deductibility of investment interest expense changed in 2003.  If the client has a margin account, the interest expenses related to that line of credit may no longer provide a tax benefit.  For example, the interest expense is only deductible to the extent that the client has net investment income, such as interest, dividends, and rental income.  However, with the creation of “qualified dividends” in 2003, these dividends are no longer included in net investment income and the client may be left with insufficient investment income by which to deduct the interest expense.  If that is the case, you may be able to offer other lending options and products (such as a home equity line of credit) that may reduce the overall cost of borrowing for the client.

    <area shape="rect" coords="2,508,796,603" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;strong&gt;4  – Charitable Contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Charitable contributions indicate the client&rsquo;s philanthropic  intentions.  Large deductions could lead  to a discussion of the benefits of a charitable trust, a private foundation, or  a community foundation as alternatives to outright gifting.  Also of importance is the nature of the  property being contributed.  &lt;br&gt;
  A number of fact-finding questions are appropriate regarding  this matter, some of which you can discern without even asking the question:
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is cash being used?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there other assets that would serve this purpose better?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did the client contribute more than was deductible in one year and is there a carry forward of the benefit?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the client realize when the deduction provides benefits?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the client&rsquo;s long-term intentions for charitable contributions?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are those intentions reflected in the client&rsquo;s day-to-day activities, in the portfolio of investments, and in the estate plan?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
By gathering this information, you can use this topic to open a discussion regarding the next  generation of a wealthy client.  For  example, you might ask an open-ended question like, &ldquo;How do you balance your  desire to make charitable contributions against your desire to leave behind an  estate for your family?&rdquo;  The client  might be surprised to find that there are techniques available to maximize the  lifetime benefit of making gifts to charities (e.g., gifting appreciated  property, charitable remainder trusts, etc.), while also preserving the estate for  loved ones (e.g., using the proceeds from a charitable remainder trust to  purchase life insurance).  You should be  prepared to discuss these options with the client.  There are many planning opportunities for  charitable contributions and the consultant should discuss these options with  the client.

 Last are miscellaneous itemized deductions.  The tax preparation fee and    investment/trust fees are reported here. The consultant can get an idea of what the competition is billing for investment management and for trust services.     You should discern the answer to the following questions:
      &lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What do you value in your relationship with these advisors?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What changes would you make in these relationships?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How have you evaluated the fees they are charging to ensure they are competitive?&lt;/li&gt;
