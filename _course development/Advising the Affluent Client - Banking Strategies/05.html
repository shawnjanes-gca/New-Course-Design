  <p>It comes as no surprise that one of the more important factors in gaining greater loyalty and commitment from affluent clients is serving their banking needs in the most convenient manner possible.  In fact, a recent survey by JD Power and Associates (Figure A) found that timely service in the branch had the most significant impact on customer satisfaction.  Certainly, convenience is not measured in terms of time to handle a transaction alone; however, this survey simply serves to confirm the obvious - affluent clients are typically busy people seeking to simplify their lives in any way possible.</p>

<p>Another interesting insight is the fact that, according to The Spectrem Group, affluent households have an average of three (3) banking relationships.  Having multiple banking relationships requires individuals to take time in coordinating these relationships, which often results in a degradation of convenience.  Advisors who are able to both respond efficiently to client needs and proactively identify additional issues that will ease their financial burdens will create greater client loyalty and commitment.</p>
  <p>Recognizing the importance of convenience to affluent clients and the fact that many of these households have accumulated multiple banking relationships, the question becomes "How do I engage my clients to capitalize on this opportunity to serve them in a more convenient manner?"  The following are effective questions you can use to get clients to recognize how you can address this importance need.</p>
