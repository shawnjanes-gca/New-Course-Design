    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A second issue that is highly relevant to the affluent client is managing short-term deposits to ensure they are getting optimal yields on these balances.  Relative to this issue, one of the first questions you should ask yourself is "Do I know how much this household holds in short-term deposits?"  Before you answer this question, consider the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do they have brokerage accounts in which they trade securities?</li>
    <li>Do they have mutual fund accounts?</li>
    <li>What other banking relationships do they have?</li>
    <li>Who do their children bank with currently?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you begin to consider these other sources of short-term deposits, it becomes more apparent that often the total short-term cash balances that affluent clients hold is much higher than they realize.  Additionally, failure to proactively manage these balances will result in less than optimal yields on these assets. Even modest increases in yields on cash reserve assets can add up and make a noticeable difference over time.</p>
  <p>Following are some effective strategies for identifying opportunities to capture additional deposits.</p>
