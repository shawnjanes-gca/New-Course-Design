  <p>In addition to serving the banking needs of your clients, it is becoming increasingly important to likewise engage your clients on other financial planning issues of importance to them as well. However, there are times when it can be challenging to get clients to open up and share relevant information with you. There are many reasons why a client may be unwilling to share financial information with you.</p>

    	<h3>Typical Reasons for an "Unwilling" Client</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>"I don't have time right now to discuss it."</li>
        <li>"You are my banker; I look to you for assistance with financial transactions and loans. My broker and CPA handle all my financial planning needs.  Why do you want to know about these issues?"</li>
        <li>They simply fear revealing information that will be used to "sell them something".</li>
    </ul>
    </em>
    </div>
<p>Whatever the reason, one fact remains the same - you need basic financial information to provide the insights and guidance your affluent clients want and expect. Understanding this challenge, the question becomes, "Where can I go to quickly uncover valuable information that I need to identify potential planning opportunities with my clients?" The answer is simple - IRS Form 1040.</p>
  <p>While you may not have every client's tax returns, this information is readily available for clients who have sought a loan from your organization.  Invariably, clients seeking a loan will be required to provide copies of their tax returns as part of the loan documentation process.  Certainly this information is helpful in the loan underwriting process; however, very few advisors ever take the short amount of time to analyze key portions of the Form 1040 to learn more about the client and identify additional planning needs.  Most often, the reason is simply the fact that the advisor does not know what they are looking for in the tax return.</p>
  <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
  <p>The pages that follow outline a quick and easy process for reviewing the Form 1040 to gather a more in-depth understanding of your clients and identify potential planning opportunities in the following areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Family Situations</li>
    <li>Investment Planning Opportunities</li>
    <li>Business Banking Opportunities</li>
    <li>Retirement Planning Needs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As you study this material, keep in mind that your purpose in reviewing the tax return is to look for opportunities, not to provide tax advice.  Clients and prospects should always be encouraged to seek the counsel of their tax advisor whenever making tax-related changes.  Also, keep in mind that it is not always appropriate for you to ask for a client's tax return and the client's approval must be given for it to be obtained.</p>
