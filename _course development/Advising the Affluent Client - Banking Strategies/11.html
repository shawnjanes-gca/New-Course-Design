  <p>Below is a copy of the U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.  Take a few minutes to orient yourself with this return, since it will dictate the structure of this course.  Our approach will be to closely look at each section of this form to explore the new planning opportunities it reveals.</p>
  <p>After you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the form, we will begin the process of showing how an individual's tax return can give you far more important information that just the client's income. It may be helpful for you to print out a copy of the complete return, which can be obtained by clicking <a href="greene/aac_banking_strategies/form_1040.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <span class="pageInstruction">Scroll through the document and place the cursor on each highlighted area to view the name of that section.</span></p>
