  <p>In any case, banking solutions (ranging from basic deposit and checking accounts to mortgages and home equity lines of credit) constitute the core component of the relationship with the client.  Once an area completely owned by banking institutions, banking services are now being offered by everyone from brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch to insurance companies such as State Farm.  One of the primary reasons for this increased competition to provide banking solutions is the fact that the banking relationship is so important to many clients, serving as a gateway to developing a deeper, more holistic relationship.</p>
  <p>Recognizing the intensifying competition in the banking arena, advisors in today's market must be more effective than ever in identifying opportunities to proactively deliver thoughtful banking solutions.  This means that advisors must be able to more effectively manage their relationships, responding to traditional servicing needs and requests, while also proactively identifying planning opportunities.</p>
  <p>Simply put, those who fail to proactively engage clients to identify banking opportunities are at risk of losing the relationship to competitors.</p>
