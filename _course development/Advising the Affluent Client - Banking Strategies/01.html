  <p>At the heart of many affluent client relationships are the banking solutions - deposit accounts, home equity lines, mortgages and other loans - that address their most traditional financial needs.  However, affluent clients obviously have a wide range of other financial needs as well, including investment planning, retirement planning, education and estate planning needs that must likewise be addressed with the same degree of care and expertise.  To retain and grow relationships with affluent clients, advisors must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proactively identify banking solutions that address their client's needs</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Leverage the information they have on banking clients to identify additional planning      needs beyond banking solutions</li>
  </ul>
