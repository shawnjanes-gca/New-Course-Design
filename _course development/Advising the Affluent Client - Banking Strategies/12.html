  <p>The beginning section of Form 1040 is often overlooked, since it contains no financial data.  However, this section identifies the members of the client's household.   You can use this information to stimulate further discussion with the client, which may reveal a number of new opportunities. <span class="pageInstruction">Click the numbered areas to learn more.</span></p>

If the client is married, the spouse’s name will appear on the tax return even if the couple does not file a “joint” income tax return.  You need to gather additional information regarding the spouse, so be sure to inquire.  If a couple files “Married Filing Separately,” why? Does the spouse work?  Does the spouse take part in the investment decisions?  Etc

      <area shape="rect" coords="280,366,312,394" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;strong&gt;2  – Dependent Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Dependent children will be listed on line 6c. Since most  people are interested in talking about their children, it provides a great  opportunity to ask some open-ended questions about the children, their ages,  and their activities.  This discussion  will give you a better feel for the lifestyle your client leads and may reveal  day-to-day situations for which the client needs assistance.  Potential needs to explore include:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educational savings &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;for clients with younger children. If there is a former marriage, are there binding obligations regarding the child’s care and education?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;General banking services for older children&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, such as checking accounts, credit cards, and even mortgages and investment management accounts. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the child have any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;special care needs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?  Often, parents will care for a special needs child in their home as long as possible.  When this is the case, they may be interested in creating a Trust that would continue providing for the child’s care if the current situation changes.  You might introduce consideration of a Special Needs Trust by asking an open-ended question that gets them to reflect on the risk of failing to plan for their deaths.  For example, you might ask: “How have you addressed the need to continue care for your child if you and your spouse were killed in a common accident?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sensitive to the possibility that a discussion about special care  needs might raise uncomfortable feelings with a client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  If the client is willing to discuss this  personal and sometimes difficult aspect of their life, let them talk and  respond with understanding and additional questions.  If you detect reticence to discuss the  subject, just let it be - you can always come back later when you have built up  more trust with the client.&lt;/p&gt;
Note that this area can be  of great emotional and financial concern, possibly even a primary concern to  your client. Advisors would do well to develop some understanding of the issues  involving special needs children and develop a network of other professionals  with specialized experience in this area. It’s a bigger market than most people  realize." >
      <area shape="rect" coords="313,387,344,419" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;strong&gt;3  – Dependent Parents&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a dependent is a parent, the client may be facing other issues. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the parent need elder care?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there significant medical expenses that are of a concern to the client?  The parent could have assets that are being expended for medical care.  Are those expenses being taken full advantage of?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the parent require in-home assistance?  If so, is the client in compliance with payroll and tax reporting rules?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there an insurance need that your firm can fulfill?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The client may be considering a pre-planned funeral for the parent or pre-paid funeral       arrangements.  Sometimes working through a medical situation or through the death of a parent can spur the client to action, wanting to avoid a similar situation when the client reaches a similar age.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a need for estate  planning or elder care expertise? Have you developed a good network of estate  planning and elder care specialists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;">
      <area shape="rect" coords="348,409,379,441" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;strong&gt;4  – Other Dependents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If children have different last names than parents, there may be a remarriage with possible financial obligations or implications.  Sometimes, the dependent named on the return may not be a member of the  immediate family.  For example, the  dependent may be a grandchild or a niece or nephew.  When inquiring as to the situation that put  the individual in the care of the client, be aware that this may be a delicate  situation and exercise great care in inquiring.   The specific situation will dictate what other questions are asked.  If possible, helpful information to obtain includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the dependent related to the client?  If so, what is the relationship?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the inclusion of this individual in the household a permanent situation? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the age of the dependent and what special considerations are there?  Take care in this area, as it, too, can raise some uncomfortable feelings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;">
