<p><strong>2. Dependent Children</strong></p>
<p>Dependent children will be listed on line 6c. Since most people are interested in talking about their children, it provides a great opportunity to ask some open-ended questions about the children, their ages, and their activities. This discussion will give you a better feel for the lifestyle your client leads and may reveal day-to-day situations for which the client needs assistance. Potential needs to explore include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Educational savings </em></strong>for clients with younger children. If there is a former marriage, are there binding obligations regarding the child's care and education?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>General banking services for older children</em></strong>, such as checking accounts, credit cards, and even mortgages and investment management accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the child have any <strong><em>special care needs</em></strong>? Often, parents will care for a special needs child in their home as long as possible. When this is the case, they may be interested in creating a Trust that would continue providing for the child's care if the current situation changes. You might introduce consideration of a Special Needs Trust by asking an open-ended question that gets them to reflect on the risk of failing to plan for their deaths. For example, you might ask: "How have you addressed the need to continue care for your child if you and your spouse were killed in a common accident?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Be sensitive to the possibility that a discussion about special care needs might raise uncomfortable feelings with a client</em></strong>. If the client is willing to discuss this personal and sometimes difficult aspect of their life, let them talk and respond with understanding and additional questions. If you detect reticence to discuss the subject, just let it be - you can always come back later when you have built up more trust with the client.</p>
<p>Note that this area can be of great emotional and financial concern, possibly even a primary concern to your client. Advisors would do well to develop some understanding of the issues involving special needs children and develop a network of other professionals with specialized experience in this area. It's a bigger market than most people realize.</p>

<p>The client may be considering a pre-planned funeral for the parent or pre-paid funeral arrangements. Sometimes working through a medical situation or through the death of a parent can spur the client to action, wanting to avoid a similar situation when the client reaches a similar age.</p>

<p><strong>4. Other Dependents </strong></p>
<p>If children have different last names than parents, there may be a remarriage with possible financial obligations or implications. Sometimes, the dependent named on the return may not be a member of the immediate family. For example, the dependent may be a grandchild or a niece or nephew. When inquiring as to the situation that put the individual in the care of the client, be aware that this may be a delicate situation and exercise great care in inquiring. The specific situation will dictate what other questions are asked. If possible, helpful information to obtain includes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Is the dependent related to the client? If so, what is the relationship?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the inclusion of this individual in the household a permanent situation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the age of the dependent and what special considerations are there? Take care in this area, as it, too, can raise some uncomfortable feelings.</p>
