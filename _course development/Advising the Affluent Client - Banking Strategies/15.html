  <p>Income from investments, in the form of interest and dividends, is found on lines 8 and 9 of the tax return.  Let's begin by examining the information to be learned in this section of the return and then examine how that information can help you identify potential investment planning opportunities with a client.<span class="pageInstruction">Click the numbered areas to learn more.</span></p>

      <area shape="rect" coords="53,26,94,66" href="#" rel="area1" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1" title="&lt;h3&gt;1 – Taxable Interest and Ordinary Dividends&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The details for taxable interest and ordinary dividends will be found on Schedule B.  Taxable interest (line 8a) is exclusive of tax-exempt interest (line 8b); however, ordinary dividends (line 9a) are inclusive of qualified dividends (line 9b).&lt;/p&gt;

      <area shape="rect" coords="683,32,797,57" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;h3&gt;2 – Tax-Exempt Interest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer is not required to provide details of tax-exempt interest.  Therefore, line 8b may be the only information you will find regarding tax-exempt interest.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;As with taxable interest and dividends, we can also estimate the value of the underlying assets.  Typically, the rate for mid-term AAA rated municipal bonds should be used.  April 2014, 10-year municipal bonds had a yield of approximately 2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;:  If line 8b indicates $5,000 of tax-exempt interest, then the estimated value of the investment is: Estimated tax-free investments = $5,000 / .02 = $250,000&lt;/p&gt;
">
      <area shape="rect" coords="685,67,800,88" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;h3&gt;3 – Qualified Dividends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dividends paid on most stocks, when properly held, qualify for a special tax rate.  Line 9b will give an indication of those dividends that qualify for this reduced rate.  The current difference in rates is 20%, which is quite significant.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Review the ratio of qualified dividends to ordinary dividends.  If qualified dividends are low relative to ordinary dividends, this could be a sign of excessive sales in the account, which prevents stocks from being held long enough to qualify for the special rate.  However, do not jump to that conclusion because there may be other explanations, such as the fact that preferred dividends are not eligible for qualified dividend treatment.&lt;/p&gt;" >

  <p>There are two key questions to be answered by this Schedule. <span class="pageInstruction">Click each question on Schedule B to learn more.</span></p>
  <p><img src="greene/aac_banking_strategies/images/2015 Schedule B - Page 1 - Interest and Dividends.jpg" alt="" width="802" height="395" usemap="#Map2"/>
    <map name="Map2">
      <area shape="rect" coords="105,114,631,226" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;h3&gt;1 – What is the market value of investments?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an estimated interest rate for bonds and an estimated dividend rate for stocks, it is possible to estimate the market value of each asset type.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For bonds, you can use an average coupon rate for mid-term bonds.  For example, the Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index will list, over the previous 5 years, an average coupon rate for 10-year corporate bonds.  Assume that rate is 6.7%.   By dividing the total interest on Schedule B by 6.7%, the advisor can estimate the amount of the investment. &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;For stocks, you can estimate the dividend rate as being from 2 to 3 percent (2.5% as an average).  Simply divide the total dividends by the estimated rate to derive the estimate of the amount invested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;:  If Schedule B shows interest income of $28,000 and dividends of $15,000, then the estimated value of these investments are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:35px&quot;&gt;Estimated bond investment = $28,000 / .067 = $418,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:35px&quot;&gt;Estimated stock investment = $15,000 /.025  = $600,000&lt;/p&gt;

      <area shape="rect" coords="106,233,634,396" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5" title="&lt;h3&gt;2 – Where are the assets invested?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of the Schedule B will reveal the payers of the interest and dividends.  Sometimes, this Schedule will list each individual security.  However, since financial institutions will mail out a single 1099 to provide the interest and dividends for an entire account,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; it is more common to see the name of the institution where the assets are held&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is particularly valuable information, as it identifies your current competition.&lt;/p&gt;" >
