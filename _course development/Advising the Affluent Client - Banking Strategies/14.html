  <p>The taxpayer's wages and salary is found on line 7 of the tax return. While this item appears on a single line, the taxpayer's compensation is far from one-dimensional.  The wage amount on Line 7 could include regular salary, bonus amounts, stock option income, commission income, special pay allowances, and deferred income.  Each of these various types of income brings with it an ability to plan and help the client.  How do you discern these things?</p>
  <p>To gain more insight into the client's compensation, go to the attached W-2 Wage and Tax Statement.  It may provide additional detail on the client's compensation and help you identify additional opportunities.  Of particular interest is Box 12, which may have one or more entries consisting of a letter followed by a dollar amount.  For our purposes, we shall focus on specific letter entries you might look for.</p>

<p>This represents the cost of group term life insurance for coverage beyond $50,000.  Further questions about this policy and others held by the client may help reveal the potential need for additional life insurance coverage.</p>
">
      <area shape="rect" coords="611,265,785,298" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2" title="&lt;strong&gt;12b – Retirement Planning&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These represent elective deferrals to various retirement plans.  Typically, you will see the letter D, which is associated with 401(k) plans.  This information gives you added insight into how aggressively the person is saving for retirement.  If you see no entries, then further inquiry on how the client is planning for retirement may reveal the need for additional assistance and/or guidance.  You might begin the conversation by asking, “How are you maximizing tax-advantaged savings vehicles to defer income and save for retirement?”&lt;/p&gt;
">
      <area shape="rect" coords="610,298,787,330" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3" title="&lt;strong&gt;12c – Education and Estate Planning&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents benefits that the employer paid under an&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; adoption assistance program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Its presence represents a significant life event for the client and, particularly if this is the first child, may open up the opportunity for a discussion regarding the client’s estate plan.  It also creates an opportunity to discuss education planning.&lt;/p&gt;">
      <area shape="rect" coords="612,333,786,364" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_4" title="&lt;strong&gt;12d – Stock Option Planning&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents income from the exercise of a &lt;strong.nonqualified stock option&lt;/strong&gt;.  When these options are exercised, they typically generate a taxable event.  If the client sold the stock after exercise, then the client had sufficient liquidity for the stock; but where did the balance of the cash go?   Further inquiry on your part may reveal liquid funds that you could assist in investing.  If the client is still holding the stock, it may represent a considerable concentration in the client’s portfolio, particularly if this represents one of several stock options.  If that proves true, you may want to ask the client, “What steps have you taken to reduce the risk associated with concentrating so much of your net worth in one security?”  This may provide an opportunity for you and your team to investigate the importance of asset allocation to help spread risk over a range of asset classes and investment sectors.&lt;/p&gt;" >
      <area shape="rect" coords="436,267,609,297" href="#" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_5" title="&lt;strong&gt;13 – Employer Contributions to a Health Savings Account&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box 13 - In Box 12, you will get an indication of whether or not your client(s) is/are deferring income into an employer’s retirement plan. However, if the employee is in a noncontributory plan, it will not show up in Box 12, but if “Retirement Plan” in box 13 is checked, your client is probably in a retirement plan and may possibly limit deductions of contributions to a traditional IRA.&lt;/p&gt;
