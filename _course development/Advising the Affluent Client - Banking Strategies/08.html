  </h1>
  <p>A final issue of relevance to affluent clients is their ability to access liquidity in the most tax-efficient manner possible.  It is highly unlikely that you will ever encounter an individual who is not interested in reducing their tax burden; however, many affluent clients fail to consider how to access liquidity in the most tax-efficient manner possible. </p>
  <p>For example, the average household in the United States has an outstanding credit card balance of over $15,799* and, according to Bankrate.com, the average variable interest rate on credit cards fluctuates near 16% as of March 2015.  As of April 2014, total U.S. consumer debt is about $3.1 trillion (Source: Federal Reserve's G.19 report on consumer credit, released April 2014). Additional statistics would only further suggest that there is a tremendous opportunity to provide objective assistance to help people more efficiently manage their cash and consumer debt. To capitalize on this potential opportunity, consider the following engagement questions below.</p>

    <h3>Effective Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What are the total outstanding balances you are currently carrying on your credit cards?</li>
      <li>What is the average interest rate you are paying on these balances?</li>
      <li>What alternatives have you considered for lowering the rate on these balances?</li>
      <li>How have you determined this is the most tax-efficient way to generate needed liquidity?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
<p>These questions will enable you to learn more about your client's financial situation and potentially uncover opportunities to address important financial needs they may have.</p>

    <p>** When discussing tax-related issues with clients or prospects, it is important that you not provide any tax advice.  Clients should be encouraged to seek the counsel of their tax advisor before making changes.</p>
