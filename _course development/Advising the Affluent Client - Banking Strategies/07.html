  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Issue #3: Inappropriately Structured Loans</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A third and very important issue impacting affluent clients is ensuring their outstanding loans are properly structured.  Interestingly, according to the IRS, affluent clients account for over 70% of outstanding mortgage balances in the United States.  This fact, coupled with the uncertain interest rate environment, underscores the relevance and importance of ensuring these debt balances are properly structured. </p>
  <p>Although this issue may be common sense to you as a financial services professional, the fact of the matter is that many affluent clients are at risk due to potentially ill-structured loans.  In fact, a recent survey by BAI found that over 25% of mortgages today are Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs), of which over 11 million will reset in the next two years.  Although no one can predict where interest rates will go over the next few years, failure to review loan structures to ensure they remain appropriate is a necessity for all affluent clients.</p>
  <p>To help clients understand the impact of rising interest rates on their loan balances, convert the complexities of a mortgage into simple dollars and cents.</p>
