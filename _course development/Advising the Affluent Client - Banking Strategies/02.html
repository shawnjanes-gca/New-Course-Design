  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Understanding the Affluent Client Mindset</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>It certainly is no surprise that affluent clients represent an attractive and potentially profitable segment of the market.  Although this fact is intuitively obvious, consider the following statistics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There are over 77 million affluent individuals in the United States<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">1</sup></li>
    <li>Affluent clients have an average of three (3) banking relationships<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup></li>
    <li>93% of affluent clients own homes</li>
    <li>58% of affluent clients have a mortgage</li>
    <li>97% of affluent clients have credit cards and spend on average more than 55% more than the average credit card user</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, capitalizing on opportunities with this important segment of the market requires professionals to more fully understand how these individuals think and make financial decisions.</p>

        <ul>
        	<li>93% of affluent clients cite "Quality of Advice" as highly important in the process of selecting a financial provider.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup></li>
          <li>Yet over 55% of affluent clients cited a level of dissatisfaction with the current level of advice they were receiving from their advisor(s).<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup></li>
          <li>Of self-directed affluent clients, 21% cited "no reason" when asked why they stay with their primary financial services institution, highlighting an alarming sense of apathy and, ultimately, risk for organizations targeting this segment of the market.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">2</sup></li>        
        </ul>

  </div>
  <p>When taken in context, the message is clear.  Affluent clients represent a highly attractive segment of the marketplace from a financial perspective and, more important, are seeking more proactive financial advice than they are getting today.  Capitalizing on this opportunity will require advisors to enhance their approach to engaging these clients on the key financial issues of relevance to them, expanding the breadth and depth of the advice that is delivered.</p>
