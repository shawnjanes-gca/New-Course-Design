<p><strong>Bill and Bonnie Blair</strong></p>
<p>Bill Blair is an engineer, age 55, and plans to retire in about five to ten years depending on Bill and Bonnie's financial ability to provide sufficient retirement income. Bill's wife Bonnie, also age 55, is a research biologist and would like to retire as soon as their last child graduates from college in three years. They are both in good health.</p>
<p>You have been asked to assist Bill and Bonnie in evaluating their retirement plans. After reviewing their financial and family information, as well as discussing their goals in some detail, you have determined the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If they continue to work for another ten years, increase their retirement savings and invest prudently, their retirement income from all sources should be about $100,000 per year from a combination of pension annuities and withdrawals from investment assets. Their retirement incomes should be able to keep pace with inflation and their residence will be paid for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will be eligible for Medicare at age 65.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their total net worth in ten years is projected to total about $1,200,000 (including their home, but not including their annuitized pensions). In ten years, they will have paid off their mortgage. They currently have no other debts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill and Bonnie live in Boston and plan to retire there since two of their three children have settled close by and they have lived in Massachusetts all of their lives. Their third child is in college and should graduate in three years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill's parents live in Florida and are in "pretty good" health. Bill's mother is developing severe arthritis. Bonnie's parents live in Arizona. Bonnie's mother has some health problems and needs some professional custodial care at home that her father is unable to provide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill and Bonnie have recently become concerned about the long-term health care of their parents. They are "getting by" financially, but they have provided modest financial assistance to their parents in the last couple of years. The Blairs wonder if their parents will be financially able to handle their health care needs as they age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill and Bonnie are beginning to wonder how they can prepare to cover their own health care needs as they age. They would "rather die" than become a burden to their children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill is a "calculating risk taker." Bonnie likes to keep all matters as predictable as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Blairs do not have a "burning desire" to sacrifice their retirement security in order to leave assets to their children, but they would like to give their children a boost by leaving them some funds when they are gone. They emphasize that they want to establish and maintain their financial and personal independence; they do not want to ever find themselves in a position of being financially dependent on others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
