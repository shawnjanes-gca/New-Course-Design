<p>Most LTCi sales literature and academic material cites nursing home statistics to validate the need for long-term care and often implies the use of those statistics to assist in selecting an MBP. For example, The American College textbook, <em>Meeting the Financial Need of Long-Term Care</em>, 2nd ed., 2005, quotes the following on pages 101 and 102 where they are discussing selection of an MBP:</p>

<p align="left">Approximately 55% of all persons currently in nursing homes have been there in excess of one year. This figure drops to about 30% for stays of 3 years or longer. On the average, the length of stays has been about 2&frac12; years. However, about 14% of stays exceed 5 years, and stays for such conditions as severe arthritis and Alzheimer's disease sometimes exceed 10 years<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>This begs the question of what are the odds of requiring assisted living care or home care, and why are these statistics often not used in sales material? Until Congress passed HIPPA in 1996, most LTCi policies did not include substantive assisted living and home health care benefits. The insurance companies are just beginning to acquire and analyze their own utilization experience. Independent research groups find it relatively easy and inexpensive to acquire longer-term <em>nursing home</em> data since nursing homes have been regulated for several years and most of their services are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid. Data regarding assisted living and home health care is much more difficult and expensive to acquire. However, as mentioned previously, the long-term care insurance industry paid out $3.5 billion in benefits in 2007 to individuals, broken down as follows:</p>
<table style="width: 650px;" border="0">

<table style="width: 600px;" cellpadding="6" align="default">

<div id="rndDiv2">
<div>
<p align="left">43.0 % of claims paid were attributed to home care</p>
<p align="left">30.5% of claims were for assisted living</p>
<p align="left">25.7 % of claims covered nursing home care.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>While meaningful statistics regarding claim duration will take more time to develop, common sense suggests that many individuals will progress from home care, to assisted living care, and finally to the more intensive nursing home care. Some individuals will require long periods of home and/or assisted living care only. Clients will usually evaluate and understand these possibilities from their own family experiences.</p>
