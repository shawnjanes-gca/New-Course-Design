    <h3>Clara Barkley</h3>
    <p>Clara Barkley is single, age 60, and is retiring after teaching high school math for 30 years. She is in good health. She owns a condominium worth about $250,000 and she has a mortgage balance of $125,000. </p>
    <p>She has personal savings of $15,000 and a Roth IRA balance of $25,000. She is covered by the Teacher's Retirement System medical coverage for life, which will supplement Medicare when she turns 65. Her pension will provide $2,500 per month for life and is indexed for inflation (no survivor benefit). Clara is not eligible for Social Security.</p>
    <p>She will supplement her income for the next five to ten years by tutoring, which she believes will add $25,000 of annual income. She requires about $2,000 per month of living expenses, which she believes her pension will sufficiently cover since the pension is indexed for inflation.</p>
    <p>Based on your conversation with Clara, her lifestyle, and investment experience, she has a low risk tolerance.</p>
    <p>Clara has two adult daughters who are both married with children of their own. Both daughters live several hundred miles away. She would like to assist with the educational costs of her current and future grandchildren and has established a trust in her will for that purpose. Clara does not want to be a burden to her children in any way. </p>
    <p>Both of her parents, who live about 300 miles away, require custodial care. Her father has Alzheimer's disease. </p>
    <p>Clara is concerned about long-term care expenses and asks you what you think she should do. Your answer?</p>
