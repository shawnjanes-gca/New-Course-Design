<h2>Group LTC Insurance</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Clients will occasionally be employed at a company that offers group LTCi coverage on a voluntary participation basis. This coverage, unlike other most forms of group health insurance coverages, is portable (meaning the employee can take the coverage with them if they terminate employment), and the coverage is typically almost identical to individual coverage. These plans will usually offer slightly discounted premiums to individual coverage and are usually issued with very limited underwriting. This last factor can make this coverage very attractive to clients who have issues that would otherwise make the acquisition of individual LTCi expensive, provide limited benefits, or possibly impossible to acquire. When possible, clients with underwriting issues should apply for this coverage on a "limited-pay" basis so that they will have a paid-up policy at the end of 10 years or age 65, etc. Once the policy is paid up, the policy is not subject to rate increases and premiums will not need to be paid from retirement income.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because the guaranteed issue or simplified underwriting of group LTCi incurs higher risk, a healthy client with no negative underwriting issues will likely be able to acquire comparable coverage for less premium by applying for individual coverage.</p>
<p>In some cases, an employer will pay all or some of the premium of group LTCi coverage, which makes the group plan more attractive. In addition, some employers will provide individual LTCi policy coverage for a select group of executives and may pay some or the entire premium cost. This coverage is also portable and may have a much lower premium than could be acquired after termination of employment.</p>
<p>Both group and individual policy LTCi coverages offered through employers are often available to the employee's family members, including parents of the employee.</p>
<p>Whenever the employer provides access to LTCi coverage, the financial professional will want to assist the client in determining if the employer's coverage is comprehensive enough to meet the objectives of the client.</p>
