                <li>People who can afford to pay LTCi  premiums, but do not have enough income-producing capital to ensure a  comfortable retirement in the event of substantial LTC costs.</li>
                <li>The prospect <em>must</em> have the ability to sustain payment of potentially increasing  LTCi premiums for life, or until the end of the limited-pay period.</li>
                <li>People who can pay LTCi premiums with  C Corp deductible dollars have more tolerance for paying premiums.</li>
                <li>People who have low risk tolerance.  This may be particularly true of high net worth clients who do not want to risk  depletion of their assets in order to provide premium care.</li>
                <li>People with substantial assets to  protect, such as business interests, real estate, collectibles, etc.</li>
                <li>People with substantial charitable  inclinations may find sufficient income via asset gifts to charitable income  trusts that can pay LTCi premiums that otherwise may not be affordable.</li>
                <li>People who believe they are  responsible for the long-term care of their parents will often purchase LTCi on  their parents.</li>
              <li>People under age 70 and in good health have a much  greater chance of finding the LTCi premiums affordable. Couples receive substantial discounts.</li>
