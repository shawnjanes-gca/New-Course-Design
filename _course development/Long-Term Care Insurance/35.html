    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Clara has first-hand experience with the risk of long-term care and wants to eliminate any financial risk of being a burden to her children. Clara's income and assets may be insufficient to cover the substantial costs of long-term care. If she were to deplete her assets, she may not qualify for Medicaid because her income may be too high.</p>
  <p>Clara would be happiest with LTCi that provided Lifetime care in an amount sufficient to cover all potential LTC costs. This would give her peace of mind, would allow her flexibility of care selection, and would fulfill her desire to assist with her grandchildren's education expenses.</p>
  <p>It is important to assist Clara in reviewing her budget to determine if she can afford coverage providing full care in her geographic area with Lifetime coverage, both now and for the rest of her life. Purchase of LTCi that is not affordable will inevitably result in a lapse of the insurance and thus compounding the risk with wasted premiums. It would be appropriate to consider alternative choices, such as a lower Daily Maximum Benefit. She could likely afford to co-insure a potential shortfall of benefits with her pension income; for example, trimming a Daily Maximum Benefit from $150 to $100 per day. A shorter Maximum Benefit Period is also a way to reduce the premium, but this may be unacceptable to her because Clara does not like risk and she is very aware of the long-term risk of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
  <p>If Clara lives in an LTC Partnership Program state, she could acquire Lifetime coverage at a lower price than a private LTCi policy. She would be able to retain her assets for security and ultimate distribution for her grandchildren. This choice would allow Clara flexibility of selecting care for the first few years of care at a lower premium, but if she needed care beyond a few years, she could thereafter be subject to the care limitations of Medicaid.</p>
