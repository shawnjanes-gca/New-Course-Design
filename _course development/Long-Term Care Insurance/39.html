    <!-- pagetitle -->

  <div class="example-box">
    <p>Hank Hopkins, M.D., age 40, is an orthopedic surgeon in South Florida. He specializes in hip replacements and earns about $600,000 per year. His wife, Hilde, is a homemaker and runs the Hopkins Foundation that assists children with physical disabilities. The Hopkins have three children, ages 11, 14 and 16. The combined net worth of Hank and Hilde exceeds $10 million, mostly in marketable securities in a managed trust, retirement plans, and personal investments.</p>
    <p>Harry and Hilde established the Hopkins Foundation ten years ago. Hank contributes $100,000 per year to the foundation and Hilde contributes a portion of her income from a family trust. They have left some assets to their children in their will (about $1 million each), but most of their estate is payable to the foundation.</p>
    <p>Hilde's parents are deceased as a result of an automobile accident several years ago. Hank's parents are both 66 years of age, live in Nashville, Tennessee, and hope to stay there near other children and lifetime friends. They have recently retired and are in good health with a modest income from a pension, Social Security, and modest savings. Hank's siblings are younger and earn modest incomes. </p>
    <p>As a physician whose patients are primarily seniors, Hank recognizes the risk of needing long-term care. His grandparents both died after long stays in a nursing home. Hank assumes that if his parents require long-term care assistance, he can, if necessary, afford to bear the costs. He desires for them to have the best care with maximum flexibility of care options. He understands that they want to stay in Tennessee.</p>
    <p>Hank has called you because he is wondering if he should purchase LTCi on his parents or if he should self-insure. He also wonders if he should also purchase LTCi on himself and Hilde, or should he just set up a &quot;side fund&quot; for potential long-term care costs. If he self-insures, he possibly would retain some of the assets if not fully utilized. What is your response?</p>
    <p>Again, on the next page, let's review this case situation in terms of the seven critical factors.</p>
