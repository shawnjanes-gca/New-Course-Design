              <p>For couples where each partner purchases an LTCi policy with less than a Lifetime Maximum Benefit Period, the two purchasers can elect to share the Maximum Benefit Period for the two issued policies. This election lowers the LTCi premium. The claims of each insured would be combined to determine when and if the Lifetime Maximum Benefit Limit is reached. In addition, the Waiver of Premium benefit typically applies to both policies if either of the two partners qualifies to receive benefits. This election should be made carefully, since the combined maximum benefit is half of the benefit provided by two policies with separate maximum benefits.</p>

              <p>Exclusions and limitations of benefit payments will vary by state and by insurance company, but most state statutes will adhere closely to NAIC model legislation. Financial professionals will prefer policies that exclude or limit benefits to a lessor degree than the NAIC model legislation exclusions and limitations listed below:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Preexisting conditions or disease for which treatment was received or recommended within six months prior to the LTCi effective date or for long-term care treatment that begins within six months of the effective date. (This is not a common exclusion.)</li>
                <li>Mental or nervous disorders, not including Alzheimer's disease. (It is generally preferable to avoid this exclusion; it is not typical in today's policies.)</li>
                <li>Alcoholism or drug addiction (non-prescribed).</li>
                <li>A condition arising out of war, participation in a felony, service in armed forces, self-inflicted injury.</li>
                <li>Services where a duplication of benefit payments would occur, such as Medicare, Workmen's Compensation, Veteran's benefits, other insurance, etc. One exception that is NOT excluded is a service provided by Medicaid.</li>
                <li>Services provided by a member of a covered person's immediate family (usually excluded unless the services are in a professional capacity and the employer of the family member services and charges are normal for any equivalent patient).</li>
                <li>Services for which no charge is normally made.</li>
                <li>Services outside the United States can be limited. (Benefits are usually restricted, but riders can often expand this coverage. Optimal plans provide international coverage for 12 months. This issue should be addressed carefully for clients who anticipate international travel.)            </li>
