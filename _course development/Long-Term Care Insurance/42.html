<p><strong>Ralph and Rhonda Beard</strong></p>
<p>Ralph and Rhonda Beard, both age 50, run a plumbing supply business in Kansas City. Their only child, Rick, age 28, also works in the business as a salesperson. It appears likely that in about ten years, Rick will take over the management of the business when Ralph and Rhonda retire.</p>
<p>Ralph and Rhonda own all of the business except for about 5% of the company stock that they have gifted to Rick. Ralph and Rhonda earn about $250,000 per year from the business. Their accountant says the business is currently worth about $3,000,000.</p>
<p>You are assisting the Beards with their retirement planning and have determined that they will have about $2,500,000 of retirement capital in ten years, in addition to their $600,000 home, which should have a paid-off mortgage in fifteen years. The current value of their retirement portfolio is $750,000. Their home is currently worth $450,000. You have estimated that their inflation-hedged retirement income will initially be about $112,000 per year at age 60, plus Social Security when they decide to begin withdrawals. This income they believe to be adequate. They may supplement their retirement income with some income from the business.</p>
<p>They hope to be able to gift up to 49% of the business to Rick over time and leave 51% of the business to Rick when they are both deceased. They are willing for Rick to receive any other assets they might own at their death, but they are more concerned about maintaining their financial independence after retirement. They do not want to draw any funds from the business after retirement since they know Rick will need to hire new personnel and maintain capital in the business to maintain inventory and good credit.</p>
<p>The Beards' risk tolerance is relatively low. After working so hard to build their business, they are cautious about financial decisions that could threaten their relative stability.</p>
<p>Ralph and Rhonda are in good health, although they have worked hard for close to thirty years and they will welcome retirement. Rhonda's parents are in poor health and her father requires custodial care. Ralph's parents are deceased. His mother was in a nursing home for 3&frac12; years prior to her death.</p>
<p>While reviewing their retirement plans with you, the Beards want to know how they will cover possible health care costs. Their parents all had problems covering the expenses. Ralph's mother ended up on Medicaid.</p>
