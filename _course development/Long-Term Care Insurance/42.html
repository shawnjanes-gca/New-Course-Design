  <div class="example-box">
    <p>Ralph and Rhonda Beard, both  age 50, run a plumbing supply business in Kansas City. Their only child, Rick,  age 28, also works in the business as a salesperson. It appears likely that in  about ten years, Rick will take over the management of the business when Ralph  and Rhonda retire. </p>
    <p>Ralph and Rhonda own all of  the business except for about 5% of the company stock that they have gifted to  Rick. Ralph and Rhonda earn about $250,000 per year from the business. Their  accountant says the business is currently worth about $3,000,000. </p>
    <p>You are assisting the Beards  with their retirement planning and have determined that they will have about $2,500,000  of retirement capital in ten years, in addition to their $600,000 home, which  should have a paid-off mortgage in fifteen years. The current value of their  retirement portfolio is $750,000. Their home is currently worth $450,000. You  have estimated that their inflation-hedged retirement income will initially be  about $112,000 per year at age 60, plus Social Security when they decide to  begin withdrawals. This income they believe to be adequate. They may supplement  their retirement income with some income from the business.</p>
    <p>They hope to be able to gift  up to 49% of the business to Rick over time and leave 51% of the business to  Rick when they are both deceased. They are willing for Rick to receive any  other assets they might own at their death, but they are more concerned about  maintaining their financial independence after retirement. They do not want to  draw any funds from the business after retirement since they know Rick will  need to hire new personnel and maintain capital in the business to maintain  inventory and good credit.</p>
    <p>The Beards' risk tolerance is  relatively low. After working so hard to build their business, they are  cautious about financial decisions that could threaten their relative  stability.</p>
    <p>Ralph and Rhonda are in good  health, although they have worked hard for close to thirty years and they will  welcome retirement. Rhonda's parents are in poor health and her father requires  custodial care. Ralph's parents are deceased. His mother was in a nursing home  for 3Â½ years prior to her death. </p>
    <p>While reviewing their  retirement plans with you, the Beards want to know how they will cover possible  health care costs. Their parents all had problems covering the expenses.  Ralph's mother ended up on Medicaid. </p>
    <p>Again, let's review this case  situation on the next page in terms of the seven critical factors.</p>
