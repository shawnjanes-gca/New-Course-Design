  <p>Clearly, the potential costs of long-term care could potentially prove to be a financial disaster for the Blairs if one (or both of them) required professional LTC services. Note that the above projected costs are only at age 65. In thirty years, today's LTC costs would more than triple at a 4% inflation rate.</p>
  <p>As a financial professional, you can assist the Blairs with their retirement planning by bringing this financial risk and a solution to their attention. LTC insurance can provide a realistic solution to the potential risk. It would give them peace of mind and give them a much more realistic chance of maintaining their primary objective of maintaining financial independence. Furthermore, Massachusetts has a LTC Partnership Program that may provide a palatable option of less expensive coverage if the premium amount becomes a budget issue.</p>
  <p>Normally, it would be appropriate to address the issue of LTCi for the Blairs' parents. However, it appears that their likely age (at least 75-80) would make premiums unaffordable and, with existing health issues, acquisition of coverage is unlikely. They should be encouraged to gather other siblings and/or parents to discuss care options, as well as to consult an elder care attorney to maximize their resources and Medicaid benefit.</p>
