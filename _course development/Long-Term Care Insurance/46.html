    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>We have spent considerable time reviewing the components of LTC policies and coverage alternatives. We now turn to the strategies you should use to engage clients in discussions about their LTC planning.</p>
  <p>Opening the dialogue on any topic of significance with any client yields optimal results when done in a genuine and personal manner. While everyone might verbalize in a slightly different way, the following questions are designed to help you be as effective as possible in getting the client to think and discuss their risk management issues.  When you get the client truly engaged in thinking about and discussing the risks of long-term care, one of two things will occur:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>First, you might discover that the client already has a well-structured and rational plan.  If this is the case, you have done your job as an objective advisor, seeking to clarify and understand       the plans that are already in place.</li>
    <li>Secondly, many clients may have overlooked this risk. To the degree that a client is uncomfortable with his or her plans, or has no plan in place on this topic at all, you have identified an area of potential  need. Moreover, because of the structure of the questions you ask, the  client becomes engaged on the topic and realizes the depth of his or her need as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With this in mind, here are some high impact, open-ended questions and positioning statements you can use with clients. No doubt, you will want to come up with some of your own.</p>
  
  <p>Given the statistical possibilities showing the probable need for long-term care, how are you planning to cover the expenses related to possible long-term care you might need in the future?</p>

		<p>The cost of healthcare services in this country continues to escalate at an alarming rate. Depending on where a client resides, it's likely they might have to spend over $67,000 a year for nursing home coverage. Having to pay for the long-term care needs of a loved one for just 10 years or less could easily drain a bank account by $800,000 dollars or more.<sup style="font-size: 8pt;">*</sup></p>

    <p>Whether they realize it or not, these statistics are clear: many clients will face significant long-term care costs in their older years.  The issues these clients must address relates to whom they would rather pass a significant part of their accumulated wealth - a nursing home or their family. </p></div>
