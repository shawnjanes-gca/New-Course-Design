<blockquote>
<p>The Beards are in a common position regarding potential LTC costs. They probably could handle relatively minor costs, but long-term costs involving more intensive care would rapidly erode their retirement capital.</p>
<p>If the business operates as a C Corp, their decision of whether or not to insure the risk gets easier. If they establish a classification of employees to be eligible for LTCi paid for by the business, the premium payments would be 100% tax-deductible to the business and not reportable as income to the insured employees, including the Beards. The tax savings to the company will pay all or a substantial portion of the employees' premium (assuming not too many employees are eligible and they are relatively young). In addition, the Beards could elect to purchase a "Limited Pay" policy premium, which would increase the premiums payable for ten years, or to age 65, but the policy would be paid-up for life, thus they would pay no LTCi premiums during their retirement.</p>
