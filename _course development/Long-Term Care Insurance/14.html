  <p><strong>Medigap Policies</strong></p>
  <p>Medigap policies are designed to supplement the Medicare A &amp; B coverages by covering deductibles, co-insurance and certain limitations of Medicare coverage. For detailed information regarding these coverages, go to <u>Medicare.gov.</u></p>
  <p><strong>Extended Group Medical Insurance</strong></p>
  <p>Some employers will allow employees to extend their group medical insurance into retirement. These plans provide coverage for medical care but minimal long-term care services are covered. This insurance typically acts like Medigap coverage with fewer limitations.</p>
