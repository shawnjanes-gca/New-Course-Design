<h2>Unique Provisions for Long-Term Care Insurance</h2>

<p>Federal legislation and requirements of tax-qualified policies have assisted insurance companies in recognizing the unique needs of senior insureds. As a result, today's LTCi policies are issued with special policy provisions listed below that are unique to long-term care insurance policies.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_1">
<div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>Nonforfeiture benefits provide a policyowner with some value (rather than none) if the policy lapses for nonpayment of premiums, provided previous premiums were paid and the policy has been in force for a number of years, typically at least three. The most common type of nonforfeiture benefit is a shortened Maximum Benefit Period that is paid-up for the life of the insured. The maximum benefit is typically the greater of one month's Indemnity Amount or the total of premiums paid while the policy was in force. This benefit may be included in the policy or offered as a rider.</p>

<div class="p7ABtrig">
<h3><a id="p7ABt1_2" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()" href="javascript:;"><strong>Contingent Nonforfeiture Benefits</strong></a></h3>
</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_2">
<div id="p7ABc1_2" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>In the event premium rate increases exceed certain limits as specified in the policy, the policyowner may, under certain conditions, opt to select a lower Maximum Benefit Period, or reduce the daily/monthly Indemnity Amount by maintaining the level of premium required prior to the increase.</p>
<p>This benefit has some value, but decreasing benefits as the policy ages may leave a client with a "meaningless" long-term care policy if the client does not have financial resources to make up the shortfall of benefits. The client might be forced into care by Medicaid, in which case all LTCi benefits would serve only to reduce Medicaid's costs. This provision highlights the fact that a financial professional should not recommend LTCi unless it appears very likely that the client will have the resources to pay premiums for the rest of his or her lifetime.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7ABw1_3">
<div id="p7ABc1_3" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>To mitigate the potential lapse of a policy by an elderly and possibly frail policyholder, an applicant for LTCi is given the option of designating a third party to receive notification of a policy in danger of lapsing due to non-payment of premium. In most states, this option must actually be declined in writing if not desired. In some cases, more than one individual or entity may be notified.</p>
