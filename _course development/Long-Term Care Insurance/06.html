              <p>An <strong><em>Alzheimer's facility</em></strong> may be a stand-alone facility or may be an adjunct unit of a nursing home or assisted living facility. Alzheimer's care requires a higher level of staffing and capabilities, thus these services typically cost more: An assisted living facility with Alzheimer&rsquo;s care, semi-private room averages $57,000 per year. A semi-private nursing home with Alzheimer&rsquo;s care averages $75,000 per year. Alzheimer's facility monthly costs can vary widely depending on services required. <em>(</em><em>MetLife Mature Market Institute, October 2010.)</em></p>

              <p><strong><em>Adult day care</em></strong> centers provide social, some medical, assisted living, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services for individuals with physical or mental limitations. Typically, family caregivers need care assistance while they are working and these centers offer caregivers relief while they pursue careers during the day. They often provide meals and transportation as well as educational and entertainment programs. The centers are usually open 6 to 12 hours per day, Monday through Friday.</p>
              <p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the fastest growing segment of older adults is the population aged 85 and older. Historically, approximately 80% of the frail elderly remain in the community and are cared for by relatives, most commonly by adult daughters. Today, however, an increasing number of women aged 35â€“54 are in the workforce and unable to care for aging parents or disabled adult children living at home. Adult day care offers a welcome solution to working caregivers.</p>
              <p>The national average cost of an adult day care center is $60 per day. (<em>Genworth Cost of Care Survey, April 2010.)</em></p>

              <p>Due to a person's cognitive or physical limitations and inability to handle day-to-day financial affairs, a <strong><em>Daily Money Manager (DMM) </em></strong>may be retained to pay bills, make bank deposits, file and maintain records of medical claims, etc. Trust companies may also provide these services. In many cases, family members may not be capable or available to handle these tasks. These services generally cost $35 - $100/hour. <em>(Bankrate.com, May 2005)</em></p>
