<h4>LTC Expense of Parents</h4>
<p>Concern about long-term care costs are not only a concern of clients as part of their own personal financial planning. In addition, many working families could be financially responsible for the care of aging parents.</p>

<h4>LTC Expense Impact on Estate Planning</h4>
<p>Long-term care expenses can erode the planned distribution of estate assets. Even a seemingly very substantial estate can be significantly depleted by extended health care, such as required by dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Depending on the extent of long-term care costs, transfer of wealth may become "optional" for many clients, while a surviving spouse (or any other dependents) may find depleted financial resources inadequate for normal living expenses, not to mention their own potential long-term care needs.</p>
<p>A business owner wishing to transfer a business interest, farm, or substantial asset to heirs may have an estate plan unravel if LTC costs deplete estate assets maintained for survivor income and estate settlement costs. Even a life insurance policy in an ILIT needs periodic contributions to maintain premium payments.</p>
