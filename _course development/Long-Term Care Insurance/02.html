  <p>The American health care system, public and private, has substantial shortfalls in providing long-term care services to citizens of all ages without regard to economic status, as illustrated by the following programs.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Medicaid</em></strong> provides a wide range of <em>medical</em> and some long-term care services to the indigent. Aside from excluding citizens who are not impoverished, this system does not provide custodial care unless the patient qualifies to be in a Medicaid-approved and participating nursing home.

<h3>LTC Expense of Parents</h3>
<p>Concern about long-term care costs are not only a concern of clients as part of their own personal financial planning. In addition, many working families could be financially responsible for the care of aging parents.</p>
<div class="explanation-widget-box">
  <p>At least 70 percent of people over age 65 will require some long-term care services at some point in their lives.<sup>(1)</sup></p>
  <p>40% of persons receiving long term care are between 18 and 64.<sup>(2)</sup></p>
  <p>The likelihood of a disability grows as we age:</p>
  <p>	     Ages 44-54: 22.6% <br>
  Ages 55-64: 35.7%<br>
  Ages 65-69: 44.9%</p>

<h3>LTC Expense Impact on Estate Planning</h3>
<p>Long-term care expenses can erode the planned distribution of estate assets. Even a seemingly very substantial estate can be significantly depleted by extended health care, such as required by dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Depending on the extent of long-term care costs, transfer of wealth may become &quot;optional&quot; for many clients, while a surviving spouse (or any other dependents) may find depleted financial resources inadequate for normal living expenses, not to mention their own potential long-term care needs.</p>
<p>A business owner wishing to transfer a business interest, farm, or substantial asset to heirs may have an estate plan unravel if LTC costs deplete estate assets maintained for survivor income and estate settlement costs. Even a life insurance policy in an ILIT needs periodic contributions to maintain premium payments.</p>
