  </h1>
  <p>The <strong><em>Elimination Period (EP)</em></strong> is a form of &quot;deductible.&quot; It is a &quot;waiting period&quot; of time that an insured must wait before qualifying for long-term care policy benefits. A longer Elimination Period will decrease premium payments and a shorter EP will increase premiums. Insurance companies and state statutes typically limit Elimination Period choices to between 0 and 730 days. The most commonly selected Elimination Periods are between 30 and 90 days.</p>
  <p>The primary criterion for selecting an Elimination Period is based on the ability to pay premiums and the ability to self-insure any LTC expenses during the Elimination Period. The financial professional can assist the client in making this decision by providing insight into the array of financial resources, both public and private, that are available to cover LTC costs.</p>
  <p>The actual terms of an Elimination Period can vary and thus promise a varied range of value to a client. We have listed below two key EP considerations to watch for in an LTCi policy.</p>

              <p>Many policies issued today allow the insured to accumulate documented short-term periods when the insured would have qualified for LTC benefits if there had been no Elimination Period.Â  Usually there is no time limitation to accumulate these days and once the necessary number of days is satisfied, the Elimination Period is satisfied for the life of the policy.</p>
              <p>For example, assume that Jack Bailey's LTCi policy has a 90-day EP and he is in a nursing home for 11 days after surgery in 2008, in a nursing home again for 12 days in 2010, receives home health care in 2016 for 10 weeks, and then enters an assisted living facility in 2017. How long does he need to be in the assisted living facility to receive benefits? If his previous LTC treatments count on a cumulative basis with no restrictions, he has already satisfied his Elimination Period (11 + 12 + 70 = 93 days). If the EP must be satisfied with consecutive care or with no accumulation of prior care, he will need to satisfy a new Elimination Period of 90 days in 2017. At a hypothetical assisted living facility cost of $3,000 per month, this would cost Jack $9,000 because of a more restrictive definition of satisfying the Elimination Period. </p>

              <p>Policies vary in how they count home health care services. Some policies will count qualifying services of one day per week as satisfying one week of the Elimination Period. Other policies may only count two or three days of care as satisfying one week of the EP. Some policies count each day as one day. </p>
              <p>Thus, the value of this provision can vary. If a policy specifies that one day of care counts as one day toward the EP, a once per week LTC patient could take 90 weeks to satisfy his EP of 90 days. On the other hand, a policy that counts one day per week as satisfying one week of the EP, the insured would satisfy the EP in 13 weeks.</p>
