  <p>Long-Term Care insurance (LTCi) has changed and evolved significantly over the past three decades. Today, insurance companies offer a wide array of coverages that can be rather intimidating in their complexity. This complexity reflects the fact that some insurance companies require several hours of agent training before they will accept LTCi applications from a licensed agent.</p>
  <p>This course will not attempt to provide a detailed explanation of the many complex contract provisions and optional benefits of LTCi policies. It will, however, review what we believe are the most relevant provisions of LTCi and identify which benefits and provisions are most relevant for the vast majority of clients. We will also offer considerations of the pros and cons of purchasing LTCi.</p>
