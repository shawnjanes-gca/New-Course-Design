<p>In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). Under the provisions of this bill, long-term care policies were divided into two segments: "qualified" and "non-qualified." "Qualified" policies issued on or after January 1, 1997, must adhere to numerous regulations and stipulations regarding LTCi established by HIPPA in order to realize specified income tax benefits regarding LTCi premiums paid and benefits received<strong>.</strong> At least 95% of policies issued today are "qualified."</p>

<p>For <strong><em>individual taxpayers</em></strong>, qualified policies provide the opportunity for individuals to <em>deduct the premiums</em> for long-term care insurance (LTCi), based on the itemized deductions on their personal tax returns being in excess of the 7.5% of the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) threshold. <em>Benefits are received tax-free,</em> although daily (cash indemnity) benefits in excess of $330 (in 2014, as indexed) may be taxable.</p>
<p>State taxation varies by state, but most states provide for deductions or tax credits, subject to limitations, for LTCi premiums paid.</p>

<div id="p7ABc1_5" class="p7ABcontent">
<p>An employer can "carve-out" or designate certain classes of employees that will be covered by LTCi. Retirees can be included as well as owners, although exceptions may apply to plans that cover just owners. A company may deduct the entire premium paid for the benefit of an employee and dependents, but the premium is excluded from the employee's income. This form of LTCi premium payment is the most advantageous from a tax standpoint.</p>
<p>Most LTCi policies can be purchased on a "limited pay" basis. This means, for example, that premiums could be paid for only ten years (10-Pay) or until age 65 (Paid-Up at 65) versus for the insured's lifetime. Such premiums are higher than premiums paid for life and still subject to rate increases, but once the payment period is completed, no more premiums are due. A paid-up LTCi policy could reduce a significant budget item in retirement. Individuals who own businesses operating as C Corporations have a significant advantage in purchasing LTCi for employees.</p>
