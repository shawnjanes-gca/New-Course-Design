    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>In the late 1980s, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported the development of a new LTC insurance model with a goal of encouraging more people to purchase LTC coverage. Four states—California, Connecticut, Indiana and New York—implemented Partnership programs in the early 1990s. By 2010, at least 45 states have implemented, or are in process of implementing, a Long-Term Care Partnership Program.</p>
  <h3>How Does the Program Work?</h3>
  <p>The <strong><em>Long-Term Care Partnership Program</em></strong> was designed to incent consumers to purchase LTC insurance who might not otherwise consider the coverage affordable. States offer the guarantee that if benefits under a Partnership policy do not sufficiently cover the cost of care, particularly in regard to <em>duration</em> of benefits, then the consumer may qualify for Medicaid under special eligibility rules while retaining a pre-specified amount of assets.</p>
  <p>The Partnership policies are issued by private insurance companies with typical duration of benefits that lasts from 1½ to 4 years. Thus, if the insured still requires care when benefit limits under the policy are exhausted, the individual can then apply for Medicaid benefits without losing a specified amount of or all assets, depending on the plan chosen. The result is consumers are protected from having to become impoverished to qualify for Medicaid, and states avoid the entire burden of long-term-care costs for plan participants.</p>

                    <p>The LTC Partnership Program will appeal primarily to a narrow sector of citizens who have the following characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>They wish to purchase LTC insurance, but find the   choice of lifetime benefits of LTC insurance too expensive and shorter   benefit periods insufficient.</li>
                      <li>Their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid.</li>
                      <li>They own enough assets to make impoverishment unpalatable.</li>

                    <p>This program will not be  attractive to most affluent or HNW clients because:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Their income from  all resources would likely   exceed the cost of Medicaid services. In the  Partnership Program, most   or all income received by the Medicaid applicant must  be applied to the   cost of care. </li>
                      <li>They will be able  to afford more comprehensive LTC insurance coverage.</li>
                      <li> They will prefer to be in control of selecting   private  services. Medicaid services for home health care and assisted   living are  limited and nursing home care under Medicaid is restricted   to Medicaid-participating  facilities on an as available basis.</li>
