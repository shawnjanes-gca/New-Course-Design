    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>This is certainly not a situation where the Hopkins "need" LTCi to prevent LTC expenses exceeding their resources. For Hank, and many wealthy people who purchase LTCi, it is a question of economic value and peace of mind.</p>
  <p>The tables below illustrate a hypothetical example of the "economic value" or calculated perspective of self-insuring vs. purchasing LTCi. The possibilities of varied coverage and actual claims are endless. In these two tables, we have assumed a moderate and substantial claim scenario.</p>
  <p>The first scenario involves the decision of self-insuring or insuring the potential cost of LTC for Hank's parents. We assume that the annual premium for comprehensive, lifetime LTCi coverage in Tennessee for Hank's parents would be about $9,500 per year.</p>
  <p>The table below compares the cumulative cost of premiums at an after-tax opportunity cost of 5% per year with two potential scenarios of long-term care costs for Hank's parents.</p>

  <p>The actual LTC costs could be substantially higher, lower, or none at all. Hank will make this decision based on how significant he believes the risk to be and to what degree he will tolerate self-insuring the risk versus delegating it to an insurance company.</p>
  <p>The same holds true for Hank's decision regarding LTCi for himself and Hilde. We assume that the premium for comprehensive lifetime coverage for Hank and Hilde would be about $4,400 per year. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The actual LTC costs could be  substantially higher, lower, or none at all. Note that the hypothetical claims  illustrated significantly exceed the opportunity cost of premiums paid, even  with a long life expectancy.</p>
  <p>If Hank chooses to establish  a &quot;side fund&quot; to cover the long-term care risk for himself and Hilde  and/or Hank's parents, the funds must be accessible to Hank and Hilde, thus  subject to estate taxation. </p>
  <p>In both situations, Hank  could opt for a lower level of benefits as a compromise between  &quot;full&quot; coverage versus partial coverage and partial self-insurance.</p>
