<p>Two options for providing long-term care that are quite common are care provided by family members and the community. While these options can certainly be beneficial, they often are selected out of necessity and result from a lack of sufficient resources to provide professional care to a family member or members.</p>
<h4>Long-term Care Provided by Family Members</h4>
<p>As discussed earlier, the cost of long-term care provided by family members can be deceptively expensive and very possibly inadequate. Even with substantial financial resources, family members will still be actively involved in the management and implementation of long-term care for a family member.</p>
<h4>Community Services</h4>
<p>A wide range of community services may be available by for-profit or non-profit organizations. Social services, adult day care, meals on wheels, companion services, etc., can serve as helpful assistance in caring for an individual or couple in need of intermediate long-term care services and provide substantial assistance, to the degree available, to family caregivers. Many of these services will require payment and can become quite expensive when care needs are substantial. Convenience and availability can be a concern.</p>
