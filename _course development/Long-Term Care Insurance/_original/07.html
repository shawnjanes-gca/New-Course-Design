<p><strong><em>Home Health Care</em></strong> is a venue that includes virtually any home environment, usually that of a family member. Technically, for insurance purposes, it can include any residence where a person resides and receives care outside of a professional care facility. Services can range from 24/7 third-party skilled care to assisted living services provided by family members.</p>
<h4>Is Home Health Care Less Expensive than a Nursing Home or Assisted Living Facility?</h4>
<p>From the perspective of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance, Home Health Care is usually less expensive than facility care because there is no facility cost. However, it may require the expense of medical equipment and modifications to the residence, such as medical response systems, stairway elevator seats, ramps, enlarged doorways, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, from the perspective of the family caregiver(s), insufficient resources to provide services not covered by medical insurance can result in any of the following impacts on family caregivers:</p>

<h4>What does home health care really cost?</h4>
<p>According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), in 2013, about 40 million family caregivers in the United States provided an estimated 37 billion hours of care to an adult with limitations in daily activities.&nbsp; The economic value of this unpaid care was about $470 billion.</p>
