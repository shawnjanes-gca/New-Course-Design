<p>The <strong><em>Maximum Benefit Period (MBP)</em></strong> or <em><strong>Lifetime Maximum Benefit </strong></em>is actually a limitation on the cumulative dollar amount of benefits the policy will pay over the lifetime of the insured policyholder. For example, if a policy has a maximum Monthly Benefit Amount of $4,500 per month and an MBP of 5 years, the actual Lifetime Maximum that can be paid by the policy is 60 months x $4,500 = $270,000, <em>plus</em> annual adjustments for inflation. The actual maximum benefit is determined by the amount of inflation through the life of the coverage and the timing of benefits actually utilized. Another way to express the same concept is to say that the actual Lifetime Maximum in the example above would be $270,000 <em>in today's dollars.</em></p>
<p>Note, too, that many paid claims in a reimbursement policy could be less than the Maximum Daily Benefit (or Monthly Benefit). For example, a maximum daily benefit of $200 would be more than sufficient to cover qualifying claim payments of $125 per day. These "unused benefits" will extend the life of the policy since the Lifetime Maximum Benefit should really be considered a finite pool of inflation-hedged funds available to pay claims with the restriction of a maximum daily benefit.</p>
<p>The EXCEPTION to the above explanation of the MBP is when a "Lifetime" MBP is selected by the applicant. In this case, there is no time limit on benefit payments, although a daily maximum restriction would still apply. For example, qualifying expenses of $250 per day would be limited to the maximum daily benefit, which might be $200 per day. However, with a Lifetime Maximum Benefit Period, the $200 maximum daily benefit would be paid for as long as the insured required care. The insured cannot <em>outlive</em> the benefits with a Lifetime MBP.</p>
<p>Typically, the applicant selects from a small menu of MBP options: usually 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, or Lifetime. This decision by the applicant can be difficult since selecting less than a Lifetime MBP raises the possibility that the policy coverage may expire before the client's need for benefits expires.</p>
