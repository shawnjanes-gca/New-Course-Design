<p>When clients are considering the risk of needing long-term care, any individual or couple must consider the realities and costs of family care. The financial professional can assist clients by having them ask themselves the following important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who will realistically be able to provide caregiving for us at home?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How certain are we that the caregiver will still be available when we need the care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How certain are we that an informal caregiver will have the necessary skills to provide care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What financial costs will the caregiver incur?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the caregiver be physically strong enough to provide care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will the family members cope with our care if we do not have the financial resources to provide for long-term care?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you think of additional questions that should be considered? What would happen in your family?</p>
