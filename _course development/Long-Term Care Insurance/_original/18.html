<h4>Types of Care Covered</h4>
<p>Policies are available that offer facility care only, home care only, or comprehensive care that covers both facility and home care. Which should clients consider? For help in answering that question, let's examine the insurance claims that are paid.</p>
<p>The American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance accumulated data for 2007 from over 60 long-term care insurers who represent 98 percent of all LTC policies currently in force. The data showed that the long-term care insurance industry paid out $3.5 billion in benefits in 2007 to individuals, broken down as follows:</p>

<p>The data above strongly suggests that a client should usually only consider a comprehensive policy that covers facility care in a nursing home and assisted living facility as well as home health care.</p>
<h4>Benefit Amounts</h4>
<p>An LTCi policy would be issued with a maximum daily or monthly benefit amount that the applicant selects at the time of application. The financial professional will need to have good data available regarding current costs of various types of services in the area where the client lives, or plans to live in the future, in order to assist the client in selecting an accurate maximum benefit amount. As discussed earlier, the location of care has a significant impact on cost. In some cases, the insurance company will stipulate a variance in the maximum daily/monthly benefit based on the type of care being provided, e.g., nursing home, assisted living, or home health care.</p>
