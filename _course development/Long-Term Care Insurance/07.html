  <p><strong><em>Home Health Care</em></strong> is a venue that includes virtually any home environment, usually that of a family member. Technically, for insurance purposes, it can include any residence where a person resides and receives care outside of a professional care facility. Services can range from 24/7 third-party skilled care to assisted living services provided by family members.</p>

  <p>From the perspective of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance, Home Health Care is usually less expensive than facility care because there is no facility cost. However, it may require the expense of medical equipment and modifications to the residence, such as medical response systems, stairway elevator seats, ramps, enlarged doorways, etc.</p>

        <li>Pressure on family members to provide services that they are not well-equipped to do</li>
        <li>Financial sacrifices by caregivers due to reduced employment time and opportunity, as well as additional hard costs</li>
        <li>Caregivers statistically show substantial increases in mental and physical health problems of their own while trying to provide care for family members over an extended period of time.</li>

  <h3>What does home health care really cost?</h3>
  <p>According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), in 2013, about 40 million family caregivers in the United States provided an estimated 37 billion hours of care to an adult with limitations in daily activities.Â  The economic value of this unpaid care was about $470 billion.</p>
