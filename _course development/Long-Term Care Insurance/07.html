<p><strong><em>Home Health Care</em></strong> is a venue that includes virtually any home environment, usually that of a family member. Technically, for insurance purposes, it can include any residence where a person resides and receives care outside of a professional care facility. Services can range from 24/7 third-party skilled care to assisted living services provided by family members.</p>
<h4>Is Home Health Care Less Expensive than a Nursing Home or Assisted Living Facility?</h4>
<p>From the perspective of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance, Home Health Care is usually less expensive than facility care because there is no facility cost. However, it may require the expense of medical equipment and modifications to the residence, such as medical response systems, stairway elevator seats, ramps, enlarged doorways, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, from the perspective of the family caregiver(s), insufficient resources to provide services not covered by medical insurance can result in any of the following impacts on family caregivers:</p>

<h4>What does home health care really cost?</h4>
<p>Peter S. Arno, PhD, from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, coordinated a national study that illuminated the substantial cost of home health care:</p>
<p>In 2004, the study estimated economic value of family caregiving ranging from $149 billion (at $5.15/hour) to $483 billion (at $14.68/hour). This cost is significantly higher than the estimated national cost of professional home care services ($49 billion) and nursing home care ($115 billion). <em>(Source: http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov)</em>. The <em>Genworth Cost of Care Survey </em>published in April 2010<em>, </em>estimates a licensed home heath aid costs about $19/hour.</p>
