    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Having examined the fundamentals of long-term care insurance, we now turn our attention to the decision of whether a person insures or not.Â  It is important to remember that the purchase of insurance of any kind is typically not required or technically necessary. Insurance is a financial tool that we may choose to use in order to alleviate intolerable financial risk. Long-term care risk intolerance is not based on a universal formula, but rather on the characteristics of the risk and the individual circumstances and attitudes of each client. To self-insure or insure the risk of long-term care expenses is a subjective decision since the need for long-term care not a certainty. </p>
  <p>As financial professionals, it is our role to fully illuminate the potential emotional and financial risks of long-term care, as well as how long-term care insurance (LTCi) can alleviate the risk.</p>

                <p>To address the decision-making process of whether or not to purchase LTCi vs. self-insuring the risk, we have listed below<strong><em> seven critical factors</em></strong> that the financial professional must understand prior to assisting the client in the decision-making process.</p>

                <p>The individual's or couple's age may influence their eligibility for coverage and will certainly affect the amount of premium necessary to maintain coverage. Not everybody is insurable. According to Genworth Financial, 57% of those who apply for long-term-care insurance at age 80 or older are declined by insurers, while only 11% of those who apply between the ages of 50 and 59 are turned down.</p>
                <p>There is a tension between accumulating adequate funds to provide sufficient retirement income and managing financial risks in retirement. If your client is in the accumulation phase, they will find it more difficult to make a decision about resolving a risk that they perceive as most likely one of old age and can thus be deferred. They will be more decisive when they are comfortable that their retirement income will be adequate to pay the premiums or that their income or capital base is possibly high enough to handle the risk.</p>
                <p>We need to remind clients that the risk of needing long-term care is a possibility regardless of age; it just increases with age. As a reminder, about 47% of the long-term care population is under age 65. </p>

                <p>The family health history may have some impact on underwriting, but more importantly, it will influence the client's attitude toward the risk of long-term care. A person whose older family members had illnesses that required lengthy custodial services in old age will probably be much more sensitive to the risk than a person who is not aware of significant long-term care needs of older family members.</p>

                <p>Are the parents of your client still living? Is it possible your client will bear some burden of their LTC costs? LTCi paid for by children is a common resolution of LTC risk for children of parents who cannot afford the premium.</p>
                <p>If your client has children, is your client concerned about being a burden to the children in the event of LTC needs and expenses?</p>
                <p>What family members could be involved in your client's LTC decisions? Where are they located? What role would your client want them to play if the client has LTC needs?</p>
                <p>Remember that if your client has a spouse, the possibility of LTC involves either or both spouses. The possible LTC needs of both spouses can result in not only substantial costs, but also the loss of a possible caregiver and absence of management of the household and personal affairs.</p>

                <p>Assets must be analyzed in conjunction with income. Typically, the level of a person's income is reflected in the value of their assets. However, a client could realize a substantial retirement income from Social Security, a pension, and annuities with modest net worth.</p>
                <p>More likely is a client with substantial assets, but with a projected lifetime income that is a small percentage of their net worth. Assets such as land, second homes, and interests in closely held businesses may not generate income and are not likely to be liquid. If the current or future sale of the assets is not preferred, this client may be a primary prospect for LTCi. If their projected lifetime income would be insufficient to pay for potential LTC costs, they would need to liquidate the assets they wish to keep and/or transfer to family. LTCi can remove the risk of unwanted asset depletion.</p>

Others may not see leaving assets to family as a high priority. Similarly, some clients may consider charitable bequests to be an important objective and a depletion of their estate may threaten this goal.</p>

                <p>This is a relatively simple but important client characteristic to evaluate when assisting with managing the risk of long-term care. The very low risk tolerant client may have a tendency to over-insure while the client who has high risk tolerance will tend to minimize insurance coverages. In any case, a financial professional can serve a client well by encouraging a realistic balance of utilizing insurance to reduce financial risk exposures.</p>
