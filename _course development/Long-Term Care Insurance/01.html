  <p>In this course, we address a risk management issue that represents a potential financial expense of significant magnitude to any client: <strong><em>Long-Term Care</em></strong>. Long-term care (LTC) refers to a continuum of medical, custodial, and social services needed when physical or cognitive limitations, usually due to the aging process, begin to restrict the ability of an individual to live independently. Long-term care services may be required for a brief period after an acute medical episode or LTC assistance may be required for many years. LTC services do not include &quot;acute medical care&quot; that results from illnesses or accidents that require skilled medical care. LTC services are typically provided in the home, community, assisted living facilities, Alzheimer's facilities, and sometimes in nursing homes.</p>

              <p>Long-term care is a distinct possibility for millions of Americans. Today's &quot;baby-boomers&quot; and their parents are living longer, but longer life expectancies are often accompanied by a need for extended custodial care and, in some cases, extended skilled medical care. According to the U.S Department of Health and Human Services, more than 70% of Americans 65 and older will need some form of long-term care.<sup style="font-size:8px;"> (1)</sup></p>

              <p>Long-term care costs vary greatly, depending on the nature of service provided and geographic location. Skilled care (the highest level of care within a long-term nursing facility in a semi-private room) nationally averages about $67,000 per year. Assisted Living facilities have a national average base cost of about $38,000 per year. Day care and home health care services can be less expensive, but only if scheduling of care is limited.<sup style="font-size:8px;"> (2)</sup></p>
              <p>Clearly, an extended need for long-term care can be devastating to a retirement income portfolio as well as estate planning and wealth transfer objectives.</p>
