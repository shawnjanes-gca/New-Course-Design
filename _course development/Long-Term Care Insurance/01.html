  <p>In this course, we address a risk management issue that represents a potential financial expense of significant magnitude to any client: <strong><em>Long-Term Care</em></strong>. Long-term care (LTC) refers to a continuum of medical, custodial, and social services needed when physical or cognitive limitations, usually due to the aging process, begin to restrict the ability of an individual to live independently. Long-term care services may be required for a brief period after an acute medical episode or LTC assistance may be required for many years. LTC services do not include &quot;acute medical care&quot; that results from illnesses or accidents that require skilled medical care. LTC services are typically provided in the home, community, assisted living facilities, Alzheimer's facilities, and sometimes in nursing homes.</p>
