  <p><strong><em>Nursing homes</em></strong> are licensed facilities that may provide <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skilled care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a nursing home provides 24/7 services by licensed health professionals such as nurses and various types of therapists, under the direction of a physician.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">skilled nursing care</a>, <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intermediate care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a nursing home provides the same service, but on a less frequent basis than skilled care.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">intermediate care</a>, and <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Custodial care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provides assistance to patients who have deficiencies in physical or cognitive functions. It is very rare for a patient with exclusively custodial needs to be in a nursing home, particularly since the cost would not likely be covered by Medicare, although it may be covered by Medicaid if the patient qualified for nursing home care.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_3">custodial care</a> services. Medicare does not cover purely custodial care services.</p>
  <p>Skilled nursing care is covered by Medicare for 20 days at no charge to the patient. The patient pays $161.00 per day (as indexed in 2016) of co-pay for a maximum of 80 additional days. No coverage is provided after 100 days.</p>
  <p>According to the <a href="http://www.longtermcare.gov/LTC" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>, over 70% of those turning 65 will utilize long-term care services in their lifetime. Of those who do, 37 percent will require nursing home care. Many will need only short-term recovery-care, but the <strong>average</strong> facility stay is about two and a half years. Note that seniors are not the only citizens requiring LTC services.</p>
  <p>The national median cost of nursing home care is $6,450 per month for a semi-private room. Private room averages are about 13% higher. *</p>
