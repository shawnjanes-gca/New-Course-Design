  <p>In summary, the client will generally make a Maximum Benefit Period choice based on emotions, their own vicarious experiences with long-term care, and their risk tolerance. The preliminary statistics indicate that the financial professional will find it difficult to suggest less than a Lifetime MBP, but budgetary restrictions may demand that clients accept shorter MBPs because they provide substantially more coverage than no coverage at all.</p>
  <p>If a client has an &ldquo;average&rdquo; need for long-term care, a five-year MBP should be more than adequate. Some insured clients will never use the coverage at all, although with much broader coverage today than was available in the past, this is becoming less likely. </p>
  <p>Most affluent and high net worth clients can afford and will choose a lifetime MBP for the assurance that they will not outlive their benefits. Some, however, will &ldquo;play the odds,&rdquo; backed up by substantial financial assets.</p>
