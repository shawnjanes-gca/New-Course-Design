  <p><strong><em>Medicaid</em></strong> is designed to provide medical and health-related services to low-income people of every age. Patients normally pay no part of costs for covered medical expenses except for a small co-payment.  Medicaid is funded by federal, state, and local tax funds.</p>
  <p>While clients might be under the impression that Medicaid can provide some form of long-term care benefits, the likelihood is that they will either not qualify for Medicaid benefits because of their income/wealth, or, after they review the coverage provided,  they will be concerned with the care restrictions or location of care available.  Medicaid <em>will</em> provide certain long-term care services in a Medicaid-approved nursing home facility for qualified individuals.</p>

              <p>To qualify for Medicaid, the government will examine an applicant's financial history, including reviews of previous year&rsquo;s income and net worth statements, to determine the ability for a client to pay for his or her own care. Specific qualifications are very complex, subject to continuing changes in an environment of tight government budgets, and vary by state within federal guidelines. Ultimately, when an individual is in need of long-term care services, the individual will need to evolve to a point of income and assets that leaves little or no room for transfer of any wealth to heirs.</p>
              <p>&quot;Medicaid planning&quot; by a competent elder care attorney may mitigate the loss of assets and income to some degree. Note that federal legislation has been, and may continue to be, passed to ensure that only the poor and impoverished qualify for Medicaid. The federal and most state governments also strongly encourage their own employees to voluntarily participate in discounted long-term care insurance programs offered as an employee benefit option paid for by payroll deduction. This is a clear indication that the government has no current intention of providing long-term care services to any Americans other than the indigent, particularly in today's environment of strained federal, state and municipal budgets.</p>

              <p>Medicaid services are generally comprehensive for medical care and may provide some long-term care services. Actual services and qualifications vary somewhat by state. Clients who assume that they will rely on Medicaid for long-term care should address the realities of qualifying for Medicaid and the ramifications of receiving this type of care:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>A client with substantive assets and/or      retirement income will not qualify or will have to deplete their wealth      before being eligible for Medicaid.</li>
                <li>A Medicaid patient is on public assistance and      loses significant ability to manage his or her care.</li>
                <li>Medicaid selects the providers of health care,      including a nursing home facility based primarily on availability, not      patient preference. (Note that most nursing homes prefer private patients      who pay more than Medicaid patients, and thus allocate a small portion or      no beds to Medicaid patients).</li>
                <li>If a Medicaid patient requires hospitalization, a      return to the previous nursing home may not be possible.</li>
              </ul>
