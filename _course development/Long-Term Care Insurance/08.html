  <p>When clients are considering the risk of needing long-term care, any individual or couple must consider the realities and costs of family care. The financial professional can assist clients by having them ask themselves the following important questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who will realistically be able to provide caregiving for us at home?</li>
    <li>How certain are we that the caregiver will still be available when we need the care?</li>
    <li>How certain are we that an informal caregiver will have the necessary skills to provide care?</li>
    <li>What financial costs will the caregiver incur? </li>
    <li>Will the caregiver be physically strong enough to provide care?</li>
    <li>How will the family members cope with our care if we do not have the financial resources to provide for long-term care?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Can you think of additional questions that should be considered? Â What would happen in your family?</p>
