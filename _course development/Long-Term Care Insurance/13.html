  <p>The <strong><em>Veterans Administration Health Care Services</em></strong> exist primarily to provide medical care for injuries and diseases resulting from military service. As a secondary priority, veterans who are unable to pay costs of medical care may be able to acquire a range of medical care services from the VA. Other veterans may be eligible to receive care if they are willing to make co-payments.</p>
  <p>VA programs do provide a range of long-term care services for veterans, although they vary by location. LTC services can include VA nursing homes (not private), outpatient care, adult day care, and domiciliary (assisted living facility) care. The qualifications to apply for and to be approved for long-term care are complex. VA benefits are most available to indigent veterans and veterans with service-related injuries or illnesses. For veterans with substantive financial resources, substantial co-pays will apply and services may be on an &quot;as-space-is-available&quot; basis. Therefore, most veteran affluent clients will likely consider this source for providing long-term care as uncertain and potentially expensive. </p>
  <p>Note: If you are interested in reviewing the details of benefits, eligibility and costs, a good deal of information is available at <u>www.va.gov</u>.</p>
