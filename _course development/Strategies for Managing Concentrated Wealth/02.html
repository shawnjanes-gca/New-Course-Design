    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The reasons individuals hold concentrated stock positions span the spectrum from entrepreneurs who have gone public to longtime holders of a security whose equity position has gone untrimmed until it now accounts for a significant portion of their wealth. Some understanding of these causes is necessary before recommending a specific solution. The following list presents some common reasons for concentrated positions that you may encounter. </p>

              <p>To freely sell stocks in the open market, they must be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. This registration process can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Companies will often forego this registration process and issue unregistered securities, particularly when dealing with mergers, acquisitions, employee stock compensation, or legal settlements. These unregistered stocks are "restricted," and are subject to certain limitations on their sale. Many times, the owners and executives of a firm will hold large positions in their company stock. Often times, those portions are "restricted." </p>

              <p>Certain key individuals associated with a company who control or influence the company's activities are deemed to be "control persons." Also, anyone who owns 10% or more of the stock is considered a "control person," unless the owner can prove otherwise. Any stock owned by a "control person" is considered control stock, and its sale may be subject to certain filings and restrictions. </p>

              <p>Often times, there is a reluctance to sell a stock concentration due to significant appreciation and the capital gains cost of the sale. This reluctance can be particularly acute with an owner who is advanced in age because the stocks may be eligible for a step-up in basis upon the owner's death, and the capital gains tax could be entirely avoided by holding it until death. </p>

              <p>Sometimes the attachment is because the stock was an inheritance or gift; at other times it is because the stock is in a company in which the owner has had a long-term relationship as an employee or as its original founder. Regardless of the cause, people often form an attachment to a stock from which they may be emotionally unwilling to part. </p>
