Depicted below are just a handful of people who made use of collars. The chart shows the losses that would have been avoided by their collars if they had been exercised on December 22, 2000.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of zero-premium collars, coupled with the fact that they require no cash outlay, has made them a popular means of managing concentration risk. To make use of them, an investor only has to sacrifice some upside potential and be willing to accept the risk of an untimely forced sale or the risk that the investor will have to settle the call with cash rather than delivering the shares.</p>
<p>These collars may be structured with <strong><em>European-style options</em></strong> that can only be exercised upon the option's expiration date, or with <strong><em>American-style options</em></strong> that can be exercised at any time during the term of the option.</p>
<p>As the chart above shows, significant losses have been avoided through the use of zero-premium collars. Given the rapid decline in technology stocks in 2000 and 2001, people are more sensitive than ever before to the risks associated with concentrated holdings, and zero-premium collars will probably increase in popularity.</p>
<p>Most people think in terms of downside risk and are drawn to the fact that equity collars provide downside protection. But do not overlook that the risk of a stock dramatically appreciating in value is nonetheless a real risk for the holder of the collar. This is illustrated by a recent event involving Ted Turner, who used a collar to protect his 4 million shares of Time Warner stock. The top of the collar was $30.45, but when America Online and Time Warner announced their merger, the stock price soared to more than $90. Not only did Ted Turner miss out on the big gains, but he found himself facing a choice between selling his stock or going into the open market and purchasing $238 million of new shares to close the call position. For most investors in that position, a forced sale would be a foregone conclusion.</p>
