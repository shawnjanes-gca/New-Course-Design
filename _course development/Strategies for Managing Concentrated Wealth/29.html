    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Similar wealth transfer strategies to those already discussed have been developed for non-charitable beneficiaries. Obviously, since no charity is involved, these techniques receive no income tax deduction. </p>
  <p>Like the charitable lead trust strategy, these are essentially techniques for transferring a future interest to the remainder beneficiaries. The asset is placed in an irrevocable trust for a period of time, during which time the grantor enjoys income from the trust or enjoys the use of the asset. When the trust terminates, the asset is transferred to the remainder beneficiaries, such as the grantor's children.</p>
  <p>The funding of the trust is potentially subject to gift taxes. But because the remainder beneficiaries do not receive the gift until a passage of time, the gift to them is discounted to a present value, which is used for computing the gift tax. </p>

<p>A primary purpose and advantage of the above is the ability to avoid or minimize transfer taxes when passing wealth to heirs. When properly structured, the gift tax impact is minimized or eliminated.  Numerous rules are associated with the structure of these instruments, so it is advisable that the client's estate planning attorney be involved in making a determination as to their appropriateness. Also, future legislation could limit the benefits.</p>
