  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Monetization Strategies: Borrowing Against the Stock</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>A second, and again very basic, approach involves borrowing against the stock. This provides the liquidity to invest the borrowed funds into a portfolio that will offer some diversification against the concentrated security or to meet cash needs.</p>
  <p>Loans  secured by stock or bond positions can be classified as one of two types:  purpose and non-purpose.  The classification of the loan depends on the  use of the proceeds.  A "<strong>purpose loan</strong>" is used to invest in  securities.  A "<strong>non-purpose loan</strong>" is a loan used for anything other than purchasing  securities.</p>
  <p>Purpose loans are exempt from Regulation U (Reg U) but must comply with Regulation T (Reg T). Reg T limits the extension of credit up to 50% of the value of the securities. However, most brokerage firms have more conservative margin limits.  If the value of the security falls below the specified equity to loan ratio (margin/Reg T requirement) the brokerage firm will make a margin call, which may force a sale of the securities if the client cannot provide other liquid funds to their account to maintain their Reg T minimums.</p>
