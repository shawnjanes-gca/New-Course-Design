    <p class="objective-leadin">This module will not give you the knowledge to replace the attorneys and tax experts; in fact, it will caution you that they are an integral part of some of these solutions. But it will give you the knowledge you need to help your clients identify potential strategies to meet their needs and goals. In particular, by studying this module, you will:</p>
    <div class="objective-points">
      <p>Become knowledgeable about the various strategies employed to manage concentrated wealth, with particular emphasis on concentrated stock positions.</p>
      <p>Understand the tax issues, such as the constructive sale rules and straddle rules, which place some limits upon what can be accomplished.</p>
      <p>Be better equipped to effectively communicate alternatives to your client and explain how they work.</p>
      <p>Be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy so that you can better advise a client on approaches that best meet their specific needs and goals. </p>

  <p>Most people, given a free hand to make changes to their portfolio, would prefer that their portfolio be well diversified. But the fact is that many portfolios contain one or more concentrated positions, and investors find themselves either prohibited from selling off the concentrated position because they are restricted or control stocks, or are reluctant to do so because of tax implications or other personal reasons. Furthermore, the likelihood of these concentrated positions occurring increases in proportion to the wealth of the individual. </p>
  <p>Many wealthy clients have excessive risk in their portfolios because they are unaware that strategies exist to help them manage the risk of concentrated positions. By presenting clients with viable alternatives, wealth management professionals can significantly reduce the risks for their clients, enhance the clients' perceived value of their relationship, and increase revenue for their organization. This may at first seem like a daunting task because some of these strategies can be quite complex, requiring the expertise of attorneys and tax experts. But the principles governing the strategies themselves are actually fairly simple and straightforward. </p>
