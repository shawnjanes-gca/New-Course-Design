  </h1>
  <p>Selecting the best strategy for a client is typically not confined to any single strategy. More often than not it involves multiple approaches. Which ones are most appropriate may depend upon such variables as the primary objective of the client, the type of asset involved, the client's charitable intent, and the client's overall financial condition/status. Thus, developing a solution is more of an art than a science.</p>
  <p>The actual execution of some of these strategies is quite intricate, and may require the assistance of one or more professionals such as an attorney or CPA. But the basic concepts around which these solutions are structured are fairly simple and straightforward. With the information available in this module, it should be possible to intelligently discuss alternatives with your client and narrow in on possible strategies.</p>
  <p>To assist you in differentiating the strategies, and weighing the pros and cons of each, the following page presents a summary of the strategies presented in this training module. Study this summary until you are comfortable that you can distinguish reasons why you might use one or the other for given situations. Then check your application knowledge in the review exercise that follows. </p>
