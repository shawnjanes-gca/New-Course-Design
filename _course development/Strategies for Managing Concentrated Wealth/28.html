  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Transfer Tax Benefits of Charitable Lead Trusts</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Although there is some benefit to the charity, the primary reason for creating a charitable lead trust is to efficiently transfer assets. Because the non-charitable beneficiaries receive the assets many years into the future, the donor is able to receive substantial discounts on the value of the gift, thus reducing the taxation of the transfer. For example, using a federal rate of 4.2%, a $100,000 contribution to a 20-year charitable lead annuity trust, paying 7.5% annually (as valued when the trust was funded) to a charity, has a gift tax value of $0. </p>
  <p>Not all situations lead to a $0 gift tax value.  Other situations, while reducing the gift tax value of the transfer, may still have a taxable value, but it may be possible to avoid paying any gift taxes through use of the Applicable Credit Amount. Nonetheless, you can readily see that this method makes it possible to transfer substantial assets in a tax-efficient manner.</p>
