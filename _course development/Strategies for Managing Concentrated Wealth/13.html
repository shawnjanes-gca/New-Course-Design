  <p>A VPF contract is an agreement to "sell forward" shares of stock and is typically structured as shown in the diagram below.</p>

The range is somewhat dependent upon the degree to which the owner wishes to retain some participation in the future growth of the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is NOT a loan, but a cash advance against a forward sale; therefore, there are no restrictions on the use of the cash and all of it can be reinvested in other securities or used for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_1">cash advance</a>, with the added <a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of this arrangement is that taxes on the sale of the securities are generally deferred by the owner until the time of settlement. Not only can taxes be deferred, but it is possible to generate a cash advance that may be larger than an outright sale, once taxes are taken into consideration.   There are, however, numerous tax requirements that must be met.  For instance, any shares posted as collateral have to be held by the counterparty and not sold.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_2">benefit of tax deferral</a> (if structured properly with the constructive sale guidelines).</td>

            	<li><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that the owner continues to enjoy the benefits associated with owning the stocks. In fact, the VPF can be structured so that the owner can continue to retain ownership of the shares at maturity by delivering cash that is equal to the value of the shares to be delivered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the owner could elect to purchase securities at that time for delivery, rather than having to deliver appreciated shares.  Provided the shares are not loaned to the counterparty, the individual is still considered to be the owner of the securities and will maintain voting rights and continue to receive dividend payments.&lt;/p&gt;

                <li><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;In a worst-case scenario, the owner of the stocks will settle the contract upon maturity by delivering all the securities.

                <li><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;Typically, VPFs are structured so that the owner gets to keep 100% of the appreciation in the shares up to a specific level. For example, the owner may get to keep all of the appreciation up to 30% of the current price. If the stock is trading at $40 per share when the contract is executed, but moves up to $52 per share by the maturity date, then the owner gets to keep the $12 of appreciation (30% of $40 = $12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract can be structured to make the potential profit from appreciation greater or smaller, depending upon the size of the cash advance to be provided. A large cash advance might result in lower participation in appreciation; a small cash advance might result in higher participation in appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

                <li><a href="#" title="&lt;p&gt;If the stock appreciates beyond the level at which the owner keeps 100% of the appreciation, then the VPF could allow the owner to receive partial participation in the additional appreciation. Continuing with the example of a stock currently selling at $40, the contract might indicate the owner keeps 100% of the appreciation up to 30% of the current price, but can only keep 20% of the appreciation thereafter. If the stock price moved to $80 by the maturity date, then the owner gets to keep the full $12 of appreciation up to a $52 price, and keeps $5.60 (20% of $28 = $5.60) from the $28 of appreciation in price from $52 to $80.  However, in most cases, the appreciation is capped at a certain level and there is not participation in additional upside.&lt;/p&gt;" class="p7TTM_trg" id="p7Tooltip_6">Possible participation in market value appreciation after exceeding that level</a></li>

The exact number of shares to be delivered or cash to be paid will depend upon the market price of the securities upon the maturity date, which will be explained on the next page. &lt;/p&gt;
