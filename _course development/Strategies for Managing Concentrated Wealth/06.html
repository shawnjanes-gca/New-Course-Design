  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Monetization Strategies: The Systematic Sale</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Instead of selling the security all at one time, a client can begin a program of systematic sales, which is defined as a disciplined process of incrementally selling the security over a period of time. The methods range from simplistic approaches such as selling a fixed number of shares on a recurring schedule, to more sophisticated techniques where more shares are sold in periods of time when the stock is outperforming the market and less are sold when it is underperforming the market. The goal in either case is to average out the price fluctuation over time and, where possible, spread the tax impact over more than one year. The advantages and disadvantages of such an approach are listed below.</p>
