  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Wealth Transfer Strategies: Charitable Lead Trusts</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>With a <strong><em>charitable lead trust</em></strong> (CLT), once the  donor makes a contribution to the trust, it is the charity that enjoys the  benefit of income from the contribution for a period of time.  When the trust terminates, assets are  transferred to beneficiaries designated by the donor.</p>
<p>The following features are found in the trust document of a charitable lead trust: </p>
  <ol start="1" type="1" style="width:95%">
    <li><span>Similar to a charitable remainder trust, a charitable lead trust may be structured to pay income       either as a <strong><em>charitable lead annuity trust (CLAT)</em></strong> or <strong><em>charitable       lead unitrust (CLUT)</em></strong>.</span> </li>
    <li><span>The trust may last for the lifetime of the donor or another individual named by the donor, or for a specific number of years. Unlike a CRT, there is no limit of 20 years if a specific number of years is chosen. </span></li>
    <li><span>The trust can be structured as a revocable grantor trust, but it is more commonly structured as an irrevocable, non-grantor trust, in which case the trust gets the charitable income tax deduction instead of the donor.</span></li>
    <li><span>Unlike a CRT, no minimum payout is required.</span> </li>
  </ol>
<p>The diagram below outlines the mechanics of a charitable  lead trust. More detail can be learned by reading the material contained in  each of the numbered bullets.</p>

&lt;p&gt;A taxable gift may be involved in assigning the remainder interest of the trust assets. The gift tax would be based on the present value of the remainder beneficiary’s right to receive the assets at some future time. Calculation of the tax depends upon the duration of the trust, the payout amount, and the rate used in the IRS tables. But due to the discounting that is derived from giving the charity years of income off the assets, considerable discounting can take place resulting in significant savings over transferring the assets directly to the remainder beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon the termination of the trust, the remainder beneficiaries receive assets from the trust. Since any transfer taxes were taken into consideration when the trust was funded, this transfer then takes place with no additional gift or estate taxes. This is quite significant, indicating that any appreciation in the market value of the assets within the trust will transfer to the beneficiary(ies) free of gift or estate taxes. The same is true of any accumulated income that was not needed to make the required payments to the charity.&lt;/p&gt;
