<p>The simple solution to a concentrated stock position is to sell the security outright, if possible, and diversify into a portfolio that is allocated to meet the needs of the client. But if the security is sold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The client can no longer participate in its appreciation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A client would lose his or her voting rights on the shares, which for some individuals is an important aspect of the ownership position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An immediate tax liability may be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For very large holdings or thinly traded issues, the sale may place downward pressure on the stock price, as illustrated in the newswire quoted in the sidebar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, investors frequently look for other solutions.</p>
