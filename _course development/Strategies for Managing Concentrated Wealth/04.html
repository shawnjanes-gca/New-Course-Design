  <h1><span class="pagetitle">The Problem with Selling a Concentrated Stock Position</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The simple solution to a concentrated stock position is to sell the security outright, if possible, and diversify into a portfolio that is allocated to meet the needs of the client. But if the security is sold: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The client can no longer participate in its appreciation. </li>
    <li>A client would lose their voting rights on the shares, which for some individuals is an important       aspect of the ownership position</li>
    <li>An immediate tax liability may be created. </li>
    <li>For very large holdings or  thinly traded issues, the sale may place downward pressure on the stock price,  as illustrated in the newswire quoted in the sidebar.</li>
  </ul>
