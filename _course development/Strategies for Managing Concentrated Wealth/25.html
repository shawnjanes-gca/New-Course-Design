<h2>Wealth Transfer Strategies: Charitable Remainder Trusts</h2>

<p>When the investor has charitable intent, a viable option for dealing with a concentrated wealth position may be through a <strong><em>charitable remainder trust</em></strong>. A charitable remainder trust is one where the asset is placed in an irrevocable trust for the ultimate benefit of a charity. During the life of the trust, the income beneficiary, usually the donor, receives an income stream from the trust, and the charity receives the contributed asset when the trust terminates. The donor may also receive an income tax deduction for the present value of the future gift to the charity.</p>
<p>The charitable trust can be structured for one or more beneficiaries for a fixed period of up to 20 years, or it can be set up for the life of one or more beneficiaries. The annual payout to the income beneficiary(ies) cannot be less than 5% or more than 50% of the value of the trust, and may include distributions of principal when the income generated by the trust is insufficient to fulfill the required payout. This "income stream" can be set as a fixed annuity, in which case the trust is referred to as a <strong><em>charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT)</em></strong>. Alternatively, it can be structured to pay out a fixed percentage that is applied each year to the market value that is current at that time, which is known as a <strong><em>charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The charitable trust, since it is exempt from income taxes, can sell the gifted asset without having to pay capital gains. Thus the trust now possesses more investable assets than could have been achieved by the original investor, after selling the asset and paying the gains tax. This places the charitable trust in a better position to generate income for the donor than the donor could have achieved for himself/herself.</p>
