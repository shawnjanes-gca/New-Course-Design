    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>When the investor has charitable intent, a viable option for  dealing with a concentrated wealth position may be through a <strong><em>charitable  remainder trust</em></strong>. A charitable remainder trust is one where the asset is  placed in an irrevocable trust for the ultimate benefit of a charity. During  the life of the trust, the income beneficiary, usually the donor, receives an  income stream from the trust, and the charity receives the contributed asset  when the trust terminates. The donor may also receive an income tax deduction  for the present value of the future gift to the charity. </p>
<p>The charitable trust can be structured for one or more  beneficiaries for a fixed period of up to 20 years, or it can be set up for the  life of one or more beneficiaries. The annual payout to the income  beneficiary(ies) cannot be less than 5% or more than 50% of the value of the  trust, and may include distributions of principal when the income generated by  the trust is insufficient to fulfill the required payout. This &quot;income  stream&quot; can be set as a fixed annuity, in which case the trust is referred  to as a <strong><em>charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT)</em></strong>. Alternatively,  it can be structured to pay out a fixed percentage that is applied each year to  the market value that is current at that time, which is known as a <strong><em>charitable  remainder unitrust (CRUT)</em></strong>. </p>
<p>The charitable trust, since it is exempt from income taxes,  can sell the gifted asset without having to pay capital gains. Thus the trust  now possesses more investable assets than could have been achieved by the  original investor, after selling the asset and paying the gains tax. This  places the charitable trust in a better position to generate income for the  donor than the donor could have achieved for himself/herself. </p>
