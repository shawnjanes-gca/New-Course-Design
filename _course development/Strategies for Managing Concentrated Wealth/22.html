              <p>If a collar "eliminates effectively all" the risk of holding a stock, then its creation could be treated as a constructive sale.  But what does it mean to "effectively eliminate" the risk?  Obviously, with a collar, the investor is still subject to some risk. But a collar could be structured with a range of 10% around the current price or 20% around the current price. Which one, if either, "effectively eliminates" the risk? </p>
              <p>The IRS is expected to eventually publish more concrete guidelines on this, but until then the acceptable range might depend upon the interpretation of the attorney or tax expert involved. In Ruling 2003-7, the IRS indicated that a three-year forward sale contract with a 25% range was sufficiently wide enough to avoid constructive sale of the underlying stock.  This is regarded by most practitioners in this area as a "safe harbor" for trades up to three years.  Tighter collars and longer terms may be acceptable, based on particular facts and circumstances. </p>

              <p>Any time you have two offsetting positions, as with a  collar, it is termed a &quot;straddle&quot; and subject to the IRS straddle  rules. When utilizing over-the-counter options to create the collar, these  straddle rules dictate that:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>A loss from a position (e.g., the purchase of puts that expire) that is part of a straddle is       only deductible to the extent that such loss exceeds the unrealized gain in the underlying long position of the stock. For tax purposes, the put cost cannot be offset by the call sales proceeds. </li>
                <ul type="circle">
                  <li>Example:  If an investor has $100,000 of unrealized gain while holding Stock X long, and has put costs (losses) of $16,000 resulting specifically from the collar (or collars) on that        position, that loss is not deductible until either:</li>
               
              <ol style="width:95%">
              	<li><span> The value of Stock X has an unrealized gain  that is less than $16,000 (the loss can be taken only to the extent that the  unrealized gain is less than $16,000; a full deduction can be taken when the  unrealized gain in the stock is less than or equal to zero); OR</span></li>
                <li><span>The long position in the stock is realized by  sale.</span></li>
              </ol> </ul>
              
              <p>Generally, any gains from cash  settlement of option sales are short-term capital gains.</p>
              <p>Thus, if an investor establishes  a zero-premium collar on a stock using over-the-counter options and the collar  expires unexercised, the straddle rules may prevent the investor from deducting  the cost of the put, while requiring the investor to pay short-term capital  gains tax on the expired call.  If the  investor's marginal tax bracket is 35%, this can create a significant after-tax  cost on the collar.  A "zero-premium"  collar now has a cost! Thus, if an investor purchased put options for $16,000  and sold call options for $16,000, the cash cost would be zero. However, if the  $16,000 &quot;put loss&quot; does not exceed the unrealized or realized gain in  the long position, the &quot;real cost&quot; of the straddle is the income  taxes payable on the sale of the call option.</p>
              <p>Note that this <em>does</em> mean that the loss on the put sales <em>may</em> never be deducted <em>if<strong> </strong></em>the  stock is never sold during the life of the owner. The IRS has noted that a  perpetually collared (at no cost to the owner) long stock position with  substantial unrealized gains is not likely to be sold prior to death when the  stock obtains a stepped up cost basis (under current law). Thus, the denial of  deductions of the collared put positions allows the Treasury to receive some  revenue and <em>the incentive to maintain a  collared position is somewhat depleted by the after-tax cost of the puts.</em> </p>
             <p>However, the straddle rules do  not come into play if the put and call are combined into a single  contract.  Under the scenario of a <strong><em>one-contract  collar</em></strong>, if the collar expires unexercised, it will create no taxable  income or loss.  Thus, no tax burden is  created by utilizing the strategy.  These  one-contract collars can be created either with options or variable  forwards.  If options are used, they must  be privately negotiated in the over-the-counter market in order to place them  in a single contract.</p>
              
                <li><strong>Straddles stop the capital gains clock.</strong> Upon entering into a       typical straddle position, the capital gains holding period on any underlying long position stops.  If       the long position already qualifies for long-term capital gains treatment, this is not an issue for the client. However, if the underlying long position is short-term, the capital gains "clock" is frozen and is actually reset (i.e., the &quot;purchase date&quot; for tax purposes is moved to the day the straddle position expires). This rule is important for a client to understand if they are looking at a straddle as a way to hedge a concentrated position while waiting for long-term capital gains treatment (it will not work).</li>
             
            <li><strong>Tax deductibility issues.</strong>  Typically, interest expenses and associated  "carrying charges" are deductible items. Under the straddle rules, any interest or carrying charges associated  with the straddle position are not currently tax deductible, but must be  capitalized (added to cost basis) during the time the client is in a hedged  position. </li>
