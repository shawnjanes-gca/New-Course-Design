  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Hedging Strategies: Using Options</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Fundamentally, options are very simple instruments. In fact, many people have used similar agreements in their everyday life without realizing it. </p>
  <div class="example-box">
  <h3>Example</h3>
  	<p>Suppose you are being transferred to a new job in San Francisco.  Your spouse goes to San Francisco on a house-hunting trip and finds the "perfect home."  But your spouse doesn't want to buy it until you can come to San Francisco and see it.  Knowing that the house will potentially sell before the two of you can see it together, the real estate agent arranges for you to pay the seller a non-refundable fee of $1,000 to give you 30 days to put in a contract on the house.  It is stated in the contract that you have the right to purchase the home at the offered price at any time during the 30 days.</p>
    <p>When you execute that contract, you have just used the basic structure of an option.  You pay a fee, non-refundable, for the right, but not the obligation to buy the house within the next thirty days for a given price.  The homeowner gets the $1,000 for agreeing to take the house off the market for thirty days and is obligated to sell at the agreed upon price if the option holder chooses to exercise the option. You feel it is worth the $1,000 to get the option to buy for the next month.  The homeowner feels the $1,000 pays his opportunity cost.</p>
    <p>This everyday situation reflects the basic structure of an option on a security.  Options can be excellent ways to manage risk.  Generally speaking, a stock option gives its owner either the right to buy a stock or sell it at a predetermined price.  By predetermining the price, some of the uncertainty and risk associated with the stock can be curtailed.</p>

  <p><strong><em>An option is simply a contract between two parties whereby one party  has the right to trade a defined security at a given price during a finite time  period.</em></strong> As such, option contracts are of two types: </p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><span><strong>Call Option</strong> - Provides the right to BUY the underlying security at a specified price</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Put Option</strong> - Provides the right to SELL the underlying security at a specified price</span></li>
  </ol>
