    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Another diversification alternative is an Equity Swap, which in some ways is similar to participating in an Exchange Fund. With this strategy, however, no exchange of shares actually takes place. Instead, what is exchanged is the performance of an equity index, such as the S&P 500, for that of the concentrated stock. For the duration of the swap, the investor must deliver the total return of the concentrated security in exchange for the total return (gain plus dividends) of the S&P 500 Index.</p>
  <p>In short, the investor receives protection similar to having invested in the S&P 500. The investor's risk is that the concentrated stock might outperform the market, but receives protection from the stock under performing the market. And since the investor's stock is not sold, no tax is triggered by this event. </p>
  <p>The advantages and disadvantages of this arrangement are listed below.</p>
