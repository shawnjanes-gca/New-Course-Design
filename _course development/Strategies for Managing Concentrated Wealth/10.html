  <h1><span class="pagetitle">Short-Against-the-Box Revisited</span>
    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>Working with the specific parameters required to avoid a constructive sale, it is still possible to make limited use of the short-against-the-box strategy, provided that the open position is closed within 30 days beyond the current tax year. Once closed, after the 60-day waiting period is observed between transactions, a new short-against-the-box position can be created. This transaction can be repeated indefinitely, going to the open market to purchase the shares needed to close the open position rather than delivering the underlying shares that are owned. <span class="pageInstruction">See below for an example.</span></p>
 
  <div class="example-box">
  	<p><strong>How to Evaluate</strong></p>
    <p>Suppose the stock is currently selling at $100 a share when the short-against-the-box transaction is initiated, and it is selling at $80 when the position is closed the following year. Further suppose that after waiting 60 days the price is unchanged and the investor again goes short-against-the-box, closing the position again next year when the price is at $120. The scenario looks like this: </p>
    <table>
      
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th width="29%" scope="col">Year 1 Transaction</th>
          <th scope="col" colspan="3">Year 2 Transaction</th>
          <th width="29%" scope="col">Year 3 Transaction</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Receive $100/share from sale of borrowed stock</td>
        <td width="17%">Pay $80/share to cover open position</td>
        <td width="7%" style="width:1%">+</td>
        <td width="18%">Receive $80/share from sale of borrowed stock</td>
        <td>Pay $120/share to cover open position</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>As can be seen, the scenario is little different from what would happen if it were possible to engage in a single hedging transaction for two (or more) years. Effectively, the investor has hedged the stock at the current price of $100. But the 60-day waiting period does subject the holding to a period of risk that would not be present if a multi-year hedging strategy were available, such risk being considerable in a volatile market. There are also the increased transaction costs. </p>
  </div>
  <p>Because it is less effective, involves more effort to carry  for multiple years, and has increased transaction costs, it is obvious that the  short-against-the-box strategy, while still possible, has significantly less  utility than prior to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. For this reason,  investors have looked for other monetization strategies. One that has grown  considerably in popularity, and which is increasingly seen as more effective  than was the short-against-the-box in its heyday, is the <strong><em>Variable Prepaid  Forward.</em></strong></p>
