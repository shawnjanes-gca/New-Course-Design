  <p>One of the reasons the short-against-the-box strategy was so popular was the fact that it was possible to borrow up to 95% of the locked-in value of the asset and use all the money to reinvest in a diversified portfolio. But the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made it very difficult to effectively put this strategy into practice for long-term protection. Yet no other strategy, short of an outright sale, provided nearly as much liquidity.</p>

  <p>To address the need for long-term protection with high current liquidity,  institutions developed what is known generically as a<strong><em> Variable Prepaid  Forward</em></strong> (VPF). VPFs are commonly  executed by company insiders looking to protect concentrated positions while  retaining upside appreciation potential. Additionally, VPFs can be structured without the prepayment feature for clients seeking protection but do not have a  need for liquidity.</p>
  <p>Essentially, a VPF is a contract to sell shares at a future point in time ("to sell forward"). The party buying the securities, the counterparty, provides an advance payment upon execution of the contract; hence, it is "prepaid." When the time comes to close the contract, the amount of the settlement with the counterparty will depend upon the market value of the stock at the time of settlement; hence, it is "variable." It is this uncertainty regarding the number of shares to be delivered and their exact cash value when the contract is closed out that keeps this arrangement from being treated as a constructive sale.</p>
