<h2>Diversification Strategies: Exchange Funds</h2>

<p>An Exchange Fund is designed specifically to address the needs of the investor seeking to diversify a concentration. By contributing the shares to an Exchange Fund, the investor can achieve the benefits of diversification without ever having to sell the shares.</p>
<p>An Exchange Fund is a Limited Partnership into which numerous investors (50-499), who must meet certain qualifying standards, place their acceptable stock holding in return for a limited partnership interest in the fund that results from all the contributions. Even restricted stock contributions may be accepted. Provided the fund holds at least 20 percent of the capital in non-liquid assets, such as real estate, this is considered a nontaxable exchange. Equally important, it is NOT considered a constructive sale.</p>
<p>As a Limited Partnership, the fund does have a General Partner who approves all contributions. Thus, to contribute to the fund, the General Partner must be interested in adding the investor's stock to the fund. This is most likely to happen when the holding is a security that meets the fund's investment criteria, i.e., large or mid cap type of portfolio. In exchange for acceptable contributions, investors receive back interests in the partnership that are proportional to the value of their contributed stocks.</p>
<p>Once an exchange fund is formed, it is closed to new investors and generally is passively managed. To achieve non-recognition of gain or loss on the contribution, Federal requirements are for a holding period of 7 years. If an investor makes a withdrawal before that time, the investor will likely incur early withdrawal penalties assessed by the fund and the investor may only receive their own shares back. Thus, investors should generally consider an exchange fund only when they can comfortably commit to leave the contribution in the fund for the long term.</p>
<p>The fund may operate for a fixed number of years, or be open-ended with no specific termination date, passing out earnings to the limited partners. When the fund is closed/terminated,<strong><em> participants do NOT generally receive back their contributed stocks</em></strong>. Instead, they receive back a portion of the shares held in the fund. The end result is that investors eventually receive outright ownership in a diversified portfolio, with deferral of the capital gains tax.</p>
