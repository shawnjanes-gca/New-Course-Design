<p>The benefits of VPFs are considerable: liquidity, downside protection, participation in appreciation, deferment of capital gains, and the fact that the owner is not locked into a sell decision but could ultimately settle the contract with cash. But they are not for every investor with a large concentration.</p>
<p>They are generally appropriate for investors who remain bullish on the stock. For owners who are bearish, this could be an expensive proposition, as the owner will be paying considerable financing costs on a stock that may depreciate in value.</p>
<p>Since these transactions are fairly complex, they are also not typically suitable for less-sophisticated investors. Nor are they appropriate for investors with less than $5 million.</p>
<p>The type of security may also have some bearing on whether or not a VPF is appropriate. VPFs may be difficult to obtain for stocks that have low market capitalization, that are thinly traded, or that are severely depressed in price.</p>
<p>Below are important advantages and considerations pertaining to VPFs.</p>
