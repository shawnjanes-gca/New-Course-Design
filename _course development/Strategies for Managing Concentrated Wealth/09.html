    <!-- pagetitle -->
  </h1>
  <p>The  short-against-the-box strategy was very popular until Congress passed the  Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Among other things, this Act specifically targeted  the short-against-the-box and similar strategies. It stated that certain  hedging strategies were essentially the equivalent of a sale of the stock,  deemed them <strong><em>&quot;constructive sales,&quot;</em></strong> and directed that they be taxed as if the underlying stock had actually been sold. The  constructive sale rules are important to understand as they may impact any  hedging strategy utilized by an investor.</p>
  <p>For most purposes, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 put an end to the use of the short-against-the-box strategy. However, the Act left some viability for short-term use of such strategies, as long as some very specific conditions (listed below) are met.</p>
 <div class="example-box">
 	<p><strong>Constructive Sales Scenarios</strong></p>
	<p>A constructive sale occurs in scenarios where:</p>
    <ol start="1" type="1" style="width:95%;">
      <li><span>Substantially all the risk of a loss in the security is eliminated </span></li>
    
    <p>AND</p>
	<li><span>The opportunity for income and gain regarding the appreciated asset is eliminated</span></li>
 	</ol>

   <p><strong>How to Avoid a Constructive Sale</strong></p>
   <ol start="1" type="1" style="width:95%;">
     <li><span>The transaction must be closed before the end of the 30th day after the end of the investor's tax       year.</span></li>
     <li><span>Once the open position is closed, the investor must hold the appreciated asset for another 60 days.</span></li>
   		<li><span>During the 60-day holding  period, the investor must not engage in any activity that would reduce his/her risk of loss on the security.</span></li>
