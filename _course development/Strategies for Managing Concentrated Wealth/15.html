<p>A properly structured VPF (which provides the investor with sufficient participation in either the upside or downside with respect to the underlying shares) should not result in a taxable event when the contract is entered into. So, for tax purposes, the owner gets liquidity without actually selling the shares. The tax impact takes place when shares are delivered for settlement. Generally speaking, the capital gain will be the difference between the cost basis of the shares surrendered and the cash advance received.</p>
<p><em><strong>This technique has tax risk. </strong></em>While the process sounds simple, it is important to remember that VPFs are considered "tax straddles" (where a position is taken on both sides of a security's price) and as such are subject to tax treatment that can be very complex. Clients must also be mindful of the constructive sale risk as discussed earlier in the section on short-against-the-box transactions. It is important, therefore, that the client's tax advisor review the transaction before its execution.</p>
<p>The importance of the tax advisor's involvement is further emphasized because of the continued scrutiny that the IRS displays toward VPFs. For example, a recent Internal Revenue Service Field Service Advice (FSA 200111011) suggests that the use of a VPF may create an immediate taxation of the underlying shares. This Advice is essentially an informal letter issued by the IRS National Office to an IRS examining agent. While such letters are not considered binding, this letter nonetheless indicates that VPFs are not immune to attack and the IRS may eventually take the position that these transactions create an immediate taxable sale of the underlying shares.</p>
