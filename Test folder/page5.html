		<p>Clearly, the first issue that individuals must address is defining how much money must be accumulated to meet future educational expenses. For most individuals, this means understanding how much money will be needed when their children go to college.</p>

		<p>The best place to begin is with an examination of current costs. The following table illustrates the average annual costs for higher education:</p>

		<p><em class="explanation-widget-box">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec venenatis sit amet mi nec varius. Nunc ac risus velit. Etiam et tempus nibh, quis sagittis augue. Cras eu ullamcorper orci. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Curabitur posuere sem eu magna luctus fringilla. Curabitur consequat justo at neque egestas venenatis. Etiam vitae orci.</em></p>

		<p>While many individuals have some understanding of the potential future costs of educating their children, very few understand the various savings options available to them, and fewer still have actually developed a clear and rational education savings strategy. In fact, a recent Harris College Financial Preparedness Poll found that 75% of investors lack basic knowledge of 529 Plans. This one study alone highlights the tremendous opportunity for financial services professionals to work with clients to help them define elective strategies for funding future education expenses.</p>
