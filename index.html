		<p>One of the more significant financial liabilities facing individuals with children is saving for college. Nearly every parent, and in some cases grandparents, cite saving for college as a major financial goal - and rightfully so. Recent studies show that in-state tuition, fees and room and board at public universities average $17,860* per year. Worse still are the figures for private education, where tuition, fees and room and board average over $39,518(1) per year. It's a wonder that doctors do not greet new parents with, "Congratulations, you've just given birth to a beautiful baby and a substantial education liability!"</p>

		<p>While many individuals have some understanding of the potential future costs of educating their children, very few understand the various savings options available to them, and fewer still have actually developed a clear and rational education savings strategy. In fact, a recent Harris College Financial Preparedness Poll found that 75% of investors lack basic knowledge of 529 Plans. This one study alone highlights the tremendous opportunity for financial services professionals to work with clients to help them define elective strategies for funding future education expenses.</p>
		<p>This course is specifically designed to equip you with the knowledge you need to engage clients in more eective discussions about education savings alternatives and to help them define an elective strategy for them given their unique circumstances.</p>
